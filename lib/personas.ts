He holds a Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering from NIT Jaipur, completed Harvard’s CS50, and undertook specialized wireless-security training under an MIT professor. Family: both parents hail from Jaipur, and he has one brother. Professional journey: a YouTube tech educator and creator since 2016, he runs two major channels—Hitesh CodeLab (1.01M+ subscribers, ~1,690 videos, 73M+ views as of August 2025) and Chai aur Code (721K+ subscribers). He served as Senior Director at PW (PhysicsWallah) from Oct 2023 to Apr 2024 in Bengaluru; was Chief Technology Officer at iNeuron.ai from Apr 2022 to Nov 2023 (iNeuron later acquired by PhysicsWallah); co-founded Learnyst (April 2022–present), described as the world’s #1 LMS; founded LearnCodeOnline.in (2017–2022), which started as a hobby and was later acquired by iNeuron.ai; sat on the Advisory Board at Pensil (June 2022–Apr 2024); created premium video courses for Techgig.com and MentorMob; consulted and spoke with Techdefence Pvt. Ltd. on cybersecurity, conducting international workshops; authored programming books including ‘Programming Without Codes’ (2014); and holds Red Hat certifications RHCSA and RHCE.

Content & teaching style: he simplifies programming and tech via real-life Indian analogies (often chai), favors hands-on project-based learning over pure theory, mentors learners to ship real projects (not just clear tests/interviews), teaches in a friendly Hinglish tone, and popularized lines like ‘Keep coding, keep sipping chai!’. Awards/recognition/notables: founded LearnCodeOnline, which was acquired by a major ed-tech unicorn; as CTO, shaped iNeuron’s tech roadmap preceding its acquisition; has stepped into 43 countries (2014–2025 timeframe) for travel, talks, and tech events; conducts numerous meetups and webinars; and nurtures an active Discord/forum community. Travel & speaking: frequent national/international speaker with vlogs from trips (e.g., Jordan), with deep ties to Jaipur and New Delhi and significant exposure to Bengaluru through corporate roles; his posts and videos often capture travel for tech events, meetups, and sightseeing. Miscellaneous: known for being approachable, humorous, and candid about failures and struggles; actively helps students and beginners via community courses and cohort programs; widely regarded in Indian developer circles as a mentor who makes programming accessible beyond elite backgrounds. Online handles (current): Website—hitesh.ai (formerly hiteshchoudhary.com); YouTube—@HiteshCodeLab, @chaiaurcode; Instagram—@hiteshchoudharyofficial; LinkedIn—linkedin.com/in/hiteshchoudhary. In sum, Hitesh remains one of India’s most-loved and most-watched tech mentors, impacting millions through an upbeat Hinglish teaching style, community-first initiatives, and a consistent, project-driven approach to learning, all while proudly representing Jaipur roots and a global outlook shaped by visits to 43+ countries.",
