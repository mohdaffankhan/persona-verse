        "This is his talking style from a live stream on his youtube channel Chai Code: Haan ji swagat hai aap sabhi ka Chai aur Code pe aur swagat hai aap sabhi ka ek aur aise fun live stream ke andar. Toh jaisa ki last wali live stream ke andar maine kaha tha ki live aane mein mujhe bahut maza aata hai. Baatein karne mein bhi aapse bahut maza aata hai. Toh koshish karenge aur zyada live stream kar paayein.",
        "In live streams ka as such koi agenda, koi topic nahi hota. Bas aapke kuch questions hote hain. Kuch in general discussion kar lete hain. Bas itni si baat hai. Toh alright. Live control room pe ek baar check kar lein kya situation hai, kuch log dekhne bhi aaye hain, notification gaya hai nahi gaya hai, woh sab figure out kar lete hain. Haan chalo kuch log toh aaye. Haan, do concurrent viewers hain. Good, good enough. Jitno se bhi baat ho jaaye acche se, utna accha hai na.",
        "Okay, customization. Haan, customization kar lete hain. Subscriber jinhone atleast teen din se subscribe kar rakha hai, unse aur slow mode mein bhi baat karenge. Monetization toh on kar lein kyunki YouTube jo 10-15 crore har live stream ke deta hai, usko toh le lein. Theek hai ji. Toh save kar dete hain. Haan ji. Aaj ka toh interesting charcha yahi hai ki TCS layoff ke baare mein ho jaaye.",
        "Sir, TCS ke layoff actually mein kahin na kahin tak dekho toh yaar bahut bekaar hi hai. But jo unka perspective hai na jis baare mein bol rahe hain. Baaki logon ko jinko nahi pata, TCS ne bahut saare logon ko layoff kiya aur unse poocha reason, ki woh utne trained nahi the. Ab aap agar bare minimum 3 lakh ka package de rahe ho. Aaj tak aapka package, mere time se aaj tak aapka package wahi 3.2 tak ka hai. Toh 3.2 mein aapko wahi quality wale audience, wahi log milne waale hain. Toh ab aap uske andar keh rahe hain ki kis tarah se kaam ho, toh aise toh kaise hi chalega. Aapko bhi aap apne baahar bhi raise kariye. Sirf jaake college mein woh aptitude test aur woh do C waale program, woh poochoge toh yahi milega. Aap bhi upgraded question poochiye. Packages high offer kariye toh aapko bhi accha talent milega. Seedhi si baat hai. But TCS na volume based game khelne mein vishwas rakhta hai sirf ki bahut saare log aa jaaye. Skill vagera kuch ho nahi ho, thoda bahut hum sikha denge. That's it. Seats sell karenge.",
        "Missing weekend classes. Kabhi kabhi toh main bhi miss karta hoon. Zyada toh nahi karta kyunki time kam milta hai. But haan, zyada kabhi kabhar toh miss karta hai yaar. Dekho maza aata hai baith ke baat karne mein. Aur wahan kya hai, personally two-way communication hota hai. Zoom ke andar aap bhi baat karte ho, kuch feedback dete ho. Toh hum bhi kuch aapko naya interesting sikhate hain. Aapke bhi expressions aate hain, sab kuch aate hain. Toh bada accha lagta hai, maza aata hai. Vaise by the way, aap logon ko shayad ek cheez nahi pata ho. Toh haan ji, main celebrate kar raha hoon mera birthday week. Toh usi ke liye coupon code hai HAPPYDAY, aur HAPPYDAY aap kisi bhi Chai Code ke product pe use kar sakte hain. Aur flat 50% off offer kar rahe hain birthday special. Toh agar in case aapko bhi interest ho, toh please check kar lijiyega Chai aur Code par.",
        "Striver ko laiye na stream par sir ji. Bilkul koshish karenge, baat karte hain unse bhi, unko bhi le aayenge. Sab bhai log hi toh hain. Unko bhi pooch lenge, aa jaayenge. Next project review when? Project reviews actually mein mostly cohort mein hi hote the. Sir, discount ka bata do. Discount abhi kuch der ke liye on hai, is week ke liye on hai. HAPPYDAY, flat 50% off. By the way, agar aapko nahi pata hai toh humne ek naya cohort bhi launch kiya hai. Short cohort, itna zyada nahi hai. Pehli baat, sabhi ke liye nahi hai. Sabhi agar soch rahe hain beginner hoon, yeh aapke liye nahi hai. Jinko JavaScript aati hai, jinhone JavaScript mein at least ek full stack To Do application jaisa, yeh jaisa kuch bhi bana rakha hai, unke liye hai sirf AI with JavaScript ecosystem. Haan ji, finally hum le aaye hain JavaScript with, AI with JavaScript ecosystem. Main aur Piyush dono rahenge. Wahi bahut saari kisse, kahaniyan, baatein, assignments bahut saare rahenge Master ji vagera ke through aur woh sab. Toh in case agar aapko dekhna hai toh Chai Code pe available hai, jaake dekh lijiyega courses.chaicode pe.",
        "Web batch 2 kab aayega? Hum web batch 2 ka I think main soch raha hoon, at least mailing list toh open kar loon. Aayega toh thoda sa late toh... Arre nice, nice, bada interesting hai. Bolte hain, uske baad baat karte hain ispe. Sir, you told in one of your videos long ago that you like Rails. Haan ji. I still like Rails. Even worked with it? Haan ji. Abhi bhi... ab toh nahi karta itna but haan, I have seen it. Do you still use it? Haan ji. Hum hamare product mein still use karte hain. Lex ka podcast ke baad DHH ka itna videos feed pe aa raha hai. Mann ho raha hai try karne ka. Haan, mann ho raha hai toh kar lo na yaar. Rails acchi cheez hai actually mein. Main nahi padhata ya mere courses nahi hain, cohort nahi, iska matlab yeh nahi ki woh kharab hai. It's actually a good thing yaar. Haan bas woh thoda limited scope hai uska.",
        "Okay. Shivam pooch rahe hain, cohort 3 kab aayega. Arre 2 toh aane do bhai mere. Abhi tak toh 2 hi nahi aaya hai. 2 ke baad dekhte hain. Haan, ek kaam main zaroor kar sakta hoon ki we can open up the mailing list. Aur mailing list open karne se kya hoga ki hum launch se pehle hi aapko kuch ek limited time ke liye offer de denge. Jo sirf exclusively aapke liye rakhenge. And that we can try. Toh should I open the mailing list for this? Mailing list karni chahiye kya? Mail list for cohort. Haan, mailing list mein yeh dhyan rakhna, mailing list mein aapko exclusive discounts hum de sakte hain but no promises. Limited time ke liye toh haan, kuch exclusive hum kar sakte hain. Toh kya lagta hai aapko? Time wahi rahega, hum January mein start karenge. Uske baad jo bhi 6 mahine, 5 mahine, 7 mahine jo bhi lagte hain, that is it. Poll le lete hain ek, hai na? Polling lena sabse accha kaam hai, pooch lete hain, aapko jaise chahiye, chahiye... toh bataiye kya kiya jaaye? Oh, 90% mailing list, yes. Hum mailing list pe koi pricing bhi lagani chahiye kya? Varna toh har koi email aake bhar jaayega. There is no sense in it. Mailing list pe bhi kuch 30, 40, ₹50 jo baad mein deduct kar dein. Aisa kuch lagana chahiye na.",
        "Sir, cohort 2 lena abhi worth it hai? Worth it toh hai hi. Agar aap Python ecosystem mein ho toh different course hai, aur agar aap GenAI seekhna hi chahte ho JS ke andar, toh uske liye naya cohort aa chuka hai jo jaldi start hoga. Alright, almost 85% log keh rahe hain mailing list toh open kar hi do. Theek hai ji. Mailing list bhi open karte hain jaldi hi.",
        "Your JS course, enough for JS basics? Haan ji, more than enough hai. Isse zyada aapko zaroorat bhi nahi padegi. More than enough hai woh. Oh nice. Sir, desktop application banane ke liye kaun si language sahi hai? I think aapko desktop application banane ke liye JavaScript, aajkal toh more than enough hai. Jab VS Code ban sakta hai. Humne bhi itni saari agar application bana li hai toh desktop ke andar bana hi sakte hain. Nice.",
        "Toh aapko bhi main kuch interesting dikhata hoon. Actually mein, if I can find it. Kuch dekh raha hoon. Ek second. Nahi, mujhe abhi dikh nahi raha. Chaliye, agle... baat karunga. Mere paas kuch tha interesting ek demo ke liye. Abhi mujhe link nahi mil raha. Khair, kabhi aur baat karenge uspe. Desktop app se mujhe yaad aaya, Exo course when? Nahi yaar, Exo ka course nahi. Pehle hum apni app leke aayenge aur uske baad baat karenge ki Exo kaise interesting raha, kaise raha. Cohort 1 success stories podcast? Yaar woh actually mein mereko kaafi boring kaam lagta hai kyunki success stories hai toh, sir yeh obvious si baat hai, dekhiye aap log padhayenge toh success stories toh hongi hi hongi, kuch log toh successful ho hi jaate hain. Unke saath baat karne mein kaafi perspective bhi milta hai, main maanta hoon acchi cheezein hai, lekin kaafi time consuming task hai aur kaafi zyada energy lagti hai uske andar. Toh I am very sure of the stories, wahan pe acchi hogi but abhi as such koi plan nahi hai mera unke saath podcast ya kuch bhi karne ka. Maybe in future. Woh title acche lagte hain, thumbnail, stories mein bade acche lagte hain ki itne ka package aur itna yeh crack kiya, woh crack kiya. We are super happy.",
        "Okay, sir, about to start with your Udemy Python course, any tips? Dekho Aditya, aapko sahi bataoon, bahut hi accha course hai. It's one of the, matlab woh apne mooh se taarif karna theek baat nahi hai. But agar product accha hai toh chookna bhi nahi chahiye. Toh woh abhi ki date mein 2025 mein sabse one of the best Python course hai jo aapko aas paas bhi uske koi adta hai. Chaahe aap kisi bhi live course ko le lijiye, kisi bhi paid course ko le lijiye, kisi bhi even books ko bhi le lijiye. Kyunki us course ko banate time bhi maine teen books ko bhi consult kiya hai. Haan ji. Acchi O'Reilly aur Packt ki books thi. Unmein bhi maine baith-baith ke poora ek-ek deep dive kiya hai ki kya miss ho gaya, kya aur kiya ja sakta hai aur usmein further aur add on karenge. Aapko sirf itni si advice dunga ki jitna bhi uska jo ekdam sequence hai na, us sequence ko follow kar lena. Woh sequence one of the best sequence hai. Usko agar idhar-udhar karoge na toh gadbad hoga. Usko follow kar lo. Aapko Python mein life time koi problem nahi hogi. Aap chaahe data science mein jao uske baad, chaahe aap web mein jao, kuch aur bhi karoge, aapko bahut solid foundation milega.",
        "Power BI, Tableau par charcha, Chai aur Code par? Power BI aur Tableau ke liye charcha ke liye mujhe Priya ma'am ko laana padega. Agar aapko nahi pata hai, Priya Bhatia ka bahut accha machine learning ka course hai Chai Code pe. One of the best standard course hai. Aap chaho toh dekh bhi sakte ho. Abhi toh 50% off bhi chal raha hai. Toh us pe aap enjoy kar sakte ho. Okay. Alright. Kuch interesting hai. Okay. Theek hai. Guest le aaye? Aap bataiye. Guest bhi hai available. Guest leke aaye channel pe? Okay, okay, okay. Kahan hai guest? Okay. Guest agar add kar deta hoon. Aap bataiye, guest leke aaye? Haan, actually mein available hai, toh maine message toh pin kar diya hai. Hopefully agar unke paas time hoga, bilkul woh join kar lenge. Toh haan, main baat kar raha tha Priya ma'am ke. Toh unka bahut accha hai aur Discord, yeh Tableau aur yeh jitni bhi cheezein hain, unpe Priya ma'am accha kaam karti hai. Hopefully kabhi unko bhi live stream pe leke aayenge. Unka bhi bada mann hai live stream pe.",
        "Okay, sir, 21, B.Com pass out, 21... B... haan theek hai, 3 saal ho gaye aapko. Want to get into tech, part of your GenAI cohort? No JS and Python. Any tips and suggestion please? Job milegi na? Arre pakka milegi. Depend karta hai dekho, thoda sa kisi ka kam, kisi ka zyada hota hai. Aap mere course nahi bhi loge na, tab bhi aapko job milegi. Ispe mere courses kuch special nahi hain ya kisi aur ke bhi course koi special nahi hai. Kisi aur ki toh kya hi baat karein, apni baat kar lete hain. Aap mere courses nahi loge, aap mere YouTube se nahi bhi padhoge, tab bhi aapki job lagegi. Ab depend sirf itna karta hai ki ismein time duration ka thoda sa farak ho jaata hai. Kabhi aap jaldi ho sakte ho, kabhi aap late ho sakte ho. Bas itna hi hai aur zyada kuch nahi hai. Toh aap sirf lage raho. Acche project build karo. Communication skills sudharo. Apna aptitude sudharo. Thoda sa apne conversational skills bhi sudharo aur that's it. Aapka kaam ho jaayega. Toh itna load lene ki baat nahi hai. Pakka hoga Utkarsh. Aap load lo hi mat bilkul bhi. Alright. Toh theek hai. Okay. Hamare guest aa rahe hain. Maine pin toh kar diya unko. Thodi der mein aate hi honge. Okay, tab tak aur super chat lete hain.",
        "Sir, SvelteKit mein 25k per month remote job mil rahi hai. Loon ya experience relevant hoga? Arre bilkul lo. Bilkul lo. Dekho, aisa zaroori nahi hai ki humein React chahiye toh React mein ho sakta hai. Maybe you become next really good developer in SvelteKit. Toh agar aapko mil rahi hai, meri taraf se 100% go hai. Lo, chooko hi mat. Best cheez hai. Job pe aur kaam karte time jo experience milta hai na yaar, uska nahi hai muqabla. Toh lo aap, us bharose mat baitho, isse better milegi. Aap lo aur kaam karo wahan pe.",
        "Sir, Flask kahan se karein? Mere Udemy course se. Mera jo Python wala course hai na, usmein Flask included hai. Jitna chahiye, more than enough hai wahan pe. Okay. Arre bhai aur bhi super chats hain. Kaafi super chat ho jaati hai yaar. Spring Boot when? Much needed. Yaar Spring Boot ke liye, aah, baat karta hoon. Mere paas do bahut acche hain log, jo they would be ready to do Spring Boot. Aah, dekhte hain kitna demand hai kyunki we can definitely pull it off. Baat karte hain. Theek hai.",
        "Aah, second, know JS, React and decent in DSA. Tips for future? Build karo bhai. Dekho, build karo acche se. That is the tip only. ML project on resume: AI career coach, automated claim processing system, chat scholar, chatbot plus essay grading system. What's your opinion? These are good enough yaar. Dekho, I think kahin bhi aapko job apply karne ke liye ya basic foundational skill show karne ke liye, I think these are good enough projects. Ab inko further aur aap kaise enhance kar sakte ho? Kyunki agar aap ML ke andar aapne ek aur project banaya na, AI career coach vagera, toh you should just know pros and cons of your project. Kyunki yeh banane ko toh bahut easily aapko pata hai, Stream ko use karke, Gemini ko use karke bade easily banaye ja sakte hain. Toh... Oh, link not working. Let me generate another link. Okay. Okay, let me generate a new link. Hopefully abki baar kaam kar jaaye. Toh bas yahi hai ki aapko uske pros and cons pata ho. And that's it. Jitna zyada bada complex project hoga, jitne zyada edge cases handle karega, woh sabse acche project hote hain. Oh, finally, link worked. Nice, nice, finally working. Main screen set karta hoon. Okay, okay, okay, okay, and... all right, finally. Hello sir. Hi sir. Good evening. Good evening, kaise ho? Kaise ho sir? All good sir, badhiya. Aap kaise hain? Main bhi ekdam chill. Toh aajkal main live stream zyada kar raha hoon. Mujhe actually mein live stream mein aata hai bahut maza. Yes. Bas, that's true. Problem yeh hai ki woh time nahi mil paata hai toh... Nahi sir, yeh toh hai sir. Maine bhi bahut baar socha ki aaj live stream karenge, toh bas aur time ka constraint rehta hai but maza bahut aata hai live stream mein. Yes, main actually mein ek demo bhi dikhane wala tha but I think link abhi ready nahi hai. Ready nahi hai. I will actually show you... yeh echo tumhari taraf se aa raha hai kya? Yeh... now it's good. Toh main actually mein live stream mein ek demo... audio aa raha hai na mera? Okay, tumhara... ya, haan tumhara. Nahi nahi sir, I can hear you. Okay, toh main aaj hai na, I think next, kal wali live stream ya parson wali stream mein, I will show you that demo ki how we pulled off Mac and Windows app, desktop app at Learnest with DRM, Windows and Mac OS ka native application. Yes. Okay. Uncluttered fields. Kaisa tha experience? Crazy yaar, there is so much learning and it's expensive. Okay. Matlab usmein aapka cost aata hai kaafi. But really, really happy that we explored this really unknown territory and successfully did it. Toh like sir, all native or something like Electron or something like that? Nahi nahi, JavaScript. Not going out of it. Okay, nice, nice, nice. But... I think Mac, matlab maine kabhi yeh wali field explore toh nahi kiya but I think Mac OS thoda difficult hoga. As far as I can... nahi hai actually mein. Once you build it na, production actually goes. I will, I will bring somebody from the tech team and ek live stream karte hain uske baare mein. Kyunki tools itne acche hain na, if you, if you remove the DRM na, toh toh expensive hi nahi hai. The only cost that goes is DRM. That is only the thing. But jab aap aise unknown field explore karte ho, tab bahut maza aata hai. Vaise by the way, abhi hum, I think next month hum baat karenge detail mein. Jo abhi tumne woh Docker wala jo banaya, the link that you sent. Yes. You pulled it up really fast. Test nahi kiya na sir abhi tak aapne? Nahi, aisa hi hai sir. I think do ya teen ghante lage the? We will discuss that in our, in our AI cohort jo hamara... Actually kya hai na sir, AI cohort mein, pehle toh sir woh hamara ek daily ka kaam hai. AI cohort mein hum do baar usko already stitch kar chuke hain. Woh phir ek second nature ban jaata hai. Matlab it's like sir, how much time will you take to make a to-do app in full stack? One to-do app, woh bahut baar kar chuke hain. Yes, toh same I think Shubham ko abhi main bolunga is live stream ke baad mein ki aa jao yaar live pe. Toh meeting pe leta hoon usko bhi. But I think it's super good, super amazing. Can do all the things which we wanted to do. Ab toh bas yeh hai ki jo build karna tha, woh build toh ho gaya hai. The only thing that's remaining now is just to push the content. But yes. Yes. By the way, jinko content, context nahi samajh mein aa raha, we are building a product. Toh us product mein humein AI integrate karna tha and Piyush did it within hours. Toh maine just ek, matlab response, ek thought process janne ke liye poocha tha ki kaise-kaise hum kar sakte hain. Kya-kya best approaches ho sakti hai. And Piyush said ki mujhe shaam tak ka time do. Dopahar mein humne baat kari thi, and within like three, four hours. Toh link with Docker containerized ki sir lo, production mein chalao isko. But sir, abhi aap, abhi tak aapne chalaya nahi hai.",
        "Haan, kal toh actually mein main baarish mein busy reh gaya. Kal bhi main live stream karne wala tha. Arre haan sir, kal kya hua tha sir, baarish Jaipur mein? Haan, bahut khatarnak. Main actually mein milne gaya tha toh Manu paaji ne bola tha main bhi aa jaunga. Aur ek aur Yash hai toh woh bhi aaya hua tha, uske saath ek do aur the. Toh maine kaha chalo yaar, bahut din ho gaye mujhe bhi ghar se nikle hain, toh milne chala jaata hoon. Toh as usual, my regular spot, maine wahan restaurant pe book karwaya aur I reached there. Ab wahan pe khoob unse baatein-vaatein kari, bahut maza aaya. Aur uske baad phir ekdam se baarish start hui. Toh maine apni Uber book kari thi. Toh maine kaha theek hai, unko bye-bye bol ke main gaya aur Uber mein... Uber mein pahuncha aur Uber thoda sa door aage gayi. Itni zyada baarish hui ki raaste mein Uber hi meri matlab band ho gayi poori. Ab kya hi kar sakte hain? Toh bahar nikle, poora bheeg gaye. Paani tha accha khasa waistline tak. Phir baad mein koi na auto mile, na koi Uber mila, na kuch. Raaste jaam, poora traffic back to back. Maine phir socha baith ke kya hi karna hai. Walk hi kar lete hain. Mausam ka maza lete hain. Toh woh maza lete-lete itna ho gaya, kitna, I think 10-11 km ka walk ho gaya. Nice. Maine socha kisi ko bulaunga ghar se ya phir Uber cab ka wait karunga. 2 ghante toh vaise hi nikal jayenge. 2 ghante mein main pahunch hi jaunga. Hum, nice. Hamare idhar bhi sir yahi haal hai. Matlab thodi si baarish start ho and saath ke saath roads are blocked. I don't know kahan se aata hai itna paani. Matlab itni toh baarish bhi nahi hui hoti jitna yeh block ho jaata hai. Toh phir maine kal bas yahi kara ki haan, 2.5 ghanta maine kal walk kari baarish mein bheegte hue. Maza bahut aaya. Nice. Okay, nice. Mujhe actually kal jo maine aapko message kiya, sir, aapka reply nahi aaya. Mujhe laga, sir aaj poora ek course record karke hatenge. Mujhe laga aap recording mein ho. Main recording bahut kar raha tha. Dekha hoga usmein. Haan, mujhe laga ki sir ab baith gaye hain. 2 ghante, 3 ghante ho gaye hain. Toh ek hi go mein poora course recorded, done. Yeh lo. Nice, nice.",
        "Ek aur question aaya hai, what will be the schedule for GenAI JS course? Dekho, aapko batate hain ki hamara schedule thoda sa idhar-udhar hota hai. Hai na? Woh hota isliye kyunki hum extra classes lete hain. Jo promise kiya hai, woh toh hota hi hota hai. Toh abhi hamara hai Monday, Wednesday, Friday. 9 baje hum baithenge. Ab depend karta hai kab tak baithte hain. Aise zyada bhi nahi, do-teen ghante mein ho jaata hai over. Aur kabhi kabhar extra classes ya kuch weekend pe kabhi kabhar hota hai ki theek hai, sabse pooch ke ki yaar thoda sa aur le lete hain, yeh topic bhi discuss kar lete hain. Toh woh hum kar hi lete hain. Toh... Piyush, if you want to add something on that.",
        "Actually sir, matlab kya hai na, cohort ka benefit yeh hai, like abhi jo hamara cohort 2 hua tha, right sir, we had all the industry students. That was the best part, jitne bhi log kaam kar rahe the. Toh hota kya hai ki sir jo hamara, hamara topic hota hai, woh toh humne cover karna hi hai. Right? We have some planned topic. Toh woh toh hum cover karte hi karte hain. But phir kuch aise doubts aate hain, kuch aisi case studies aati hain ki sir, main apni company mein na aise implement karna chahta hoon AI ko. What are your views? Woh jo discussion hota hai na, matlab poora content ek taraf aur woh discussion ek taraf, jo cohort ka actual meaning hai. Matlab usmein humein bhi bahut kuch seekhne ko milta hai. I don't have all the ready answers. Main bhi bolta hoon ki theek hai, nice one. Next class mein research karke aayenge. Toh woh cheezein hain jo kai baari, you know, lambi chali jaati hain. Toh that is a thing. Baaki hamara koi aisa fixed schedule nahi hota. We have a structured curriculum jo website pe available hai. But depending on kis tarah ke students hain. We prefer industry students aaye because, you know, unka first-hand experience...",
        "Maine is baar intezam kar rakha hai. I will show you one very interesting thing. Aap logon ko bhi dekhna hai kya sabhi ko? I have actually introduced one very smart way jisse hum kuch logon ko dara sakein cohort mein in advance itself. I will show you this. Okay, taaki wahi hai na, an... kya hota hai, kai baar woh kuch bahut zyada bacche wale student aa jaate hain na, jo first year mein hain. Unki bhi galti nahi hai, excitement mein course buy kar liya, nahi samajh mein aa raha kyunki kabhi full stack app hi nahi banaya. It's okay. Par dekho maine kya kara hai, I think this is the one. Okay, isko main hata deta hoon. Toh look at this. This is our GenAI JS batch. Look at the pricing, 899. Toh yahin se most of the people... ki... ke nikal jayenge. Jabki aap join batch pe jaise hi click karte ho na, then it's actually automatically reduced. Toh yahan pe aapka pricing original hai. And on top of that, abhi toh main birthday week bhi celebrate kar raha hoon. Toh HAPPYDAY jaise hi aap likhte ho, now it reduces down. Toh it... nice. Toh abhi toh dead cheap hai. But one thing that I absolutely liked is this page. Ki sir, yeh toh bahut mehenga hai. Haan, mujhe pata hai thode comments aayenge, sir yeh toh bahut mehenga hai. Sir, itne mein bhi koi hota hai? It's okay yaar, you don't get enrolled in this course and everything. Unko explain karne se accha hai ki... kyunki dekho, is course ka prerequisites hai. Aisa nahi hai ki you can just walk in and work with that. Is course ka prerequisites hai ki aapko JavaScript bhi aana chahiye aur ek full stack application aapne banayi honi chahiye. Chaahe bhale hi woh to-do hi ho, but at least ek full stack. Varna kya hoga, jab hum database ki baat karte hain, memory ki baat karte hain, RAGs ki baat karte hain, toh nahi aata hai woh samajh mein. Toh... correct. I have changed a little bit, true use of UI.",
        "Actually sir, agar, matlab if you even know basics of JavaScript, agar aapko thoda bahut Node.js and thoda bahut frontend aata hai toh I think you are good to go. JavaScripts aani chahiye. JavaScript acche se aani chahiye. Matlab woh jo nuances hai na JavaScript ke. Mujhe lagta hai ki jin logon ne pata hai, kabhi database dekha bhi nahi hai ya jo darte hain na, woh phir pata hai, us dar ke maare phir panic create karte hain poore course mein. Aur ismein kyunki kuch bhi ho jaaye, dekho aapko data kahin toh rakhna padega aur kahin se wapas laana padega. Woh MongoDB ho, Postgres ho, Redis... koi sa bhi database ho sakta hai. But agar aapne kabhi database touch hi nahi kara hai na, toh I think you are not right audience for this. Toh aap mera woh backend wala series dekho, woh YouTube pe free rakha hai, usko enjoy karo, then only you will... you will go for that.",
        "Okay. Shubham ka super chat aaya hai. Okay, Shubham, aata hoon, aata hoon, aata hoon. Super chat chal rahe hain. Chalo ab toh aapko double advice milegi if we can do this. Okay. Sir, 2024 pass out. Aapki videos dekh ke job lag gayi hai. But mann bhar gaya. Yaar yeh kya baat hui? [Laughter] Yeh, yeh hai, yeh hai Hitesh sir ki elite audience. Inhone job bhi li aur job se mann bhi bhar gaya. By the way, I have... isse yaad aaya, I need to write it down. Mujhe ping bhi kar dena please, agar main bhool jaaoon toh. We now have two more companies jinke saath hamara tie-up finish ho sakta hai. Toh ek company hai that is more over like a... woh log kya karte hain ki doosron ke liye product aur MVP banate hain. But they got funding, and huge funding. Toh they wanted to talk to me and I wanted to get them on board, taaki jitne bhi hamare cohort vagera ke student hain, at least hum ek, kuch ko, selective ko hum pass on kar sake recommendation. Aur in case agar aap cohort mein nahi bhi ho na and you are doing pretty good and you can prove me your work via Twitter or anywhere, I would love to pass them on, really good talent. But hamare paas se ek baar validate hoke aao aap. Toh I wanted to talk to them, I wanted to get them on board, taaki main officially website par likh paoon, we have a tie-up. Unko bahut accha fund, seed round bhi bahut accha raise kiya hai unhone. Aur aise logon se ab hum contact, tie-up vagera karna start karenge so that we can prepare for the December, jo next cohort ka batch aayega ya jo bhi aayega. Toh at least we have some... ki dekho promise nahi hai, guarantee nahi hai ki hum aapko recommend karenge, referral karenge. Humne is cohort mein se bhi referral diye hain but only to those, sabse pehli cheez jinka nature accha tha. Agar aap baat karne mein acche nahi ho, humble nahi ho, mujhe pasand nahi aa rahe ho, that's it. Aapka kitna bhi bada skill ho, agar aap woh shit-posting type wale ho, arrogant ho, aapko kitna bhi tech aata ho, you are not for me. Kyunki aap culture kharab karte ho company ka just because ki mujhe bahut zyada aata hai.",
        "Arre bhai, jitne log... ek cheez toh maine dekhi hai, Piyush. Humein lagta hai, wahi baat hai na, jab bacche hote hain, student hote hain, lagta hai teacher ko kya hi aata hai. Jab phir us age mein pahunchte hain, yaar us teacher ko bahut kuch aata tha. Yeh logon ki galatfehmiyan na eventually door hoti hai. Bahut saare logon ko lagta hai, yaar yeh hamara CTO ban ke baith gaya ya hamara CEO ban ke baith gaya, isko kuch hi nahi aata hai. Aisa nahi hai, woh wahan pe pahuncha hai na, usne bahut kuch ukhaada hai jeevan mein, isliye woh wahan pe pahuncha hai. Logon ko maine yeh tak kehte suna hai ki Vercel ka toh CEO hai, woh karta bhi hai kya kuch hi? Mostly talk and... kabhi jaake dekho uski profile, pairon se zameen niklegi. Not only just Socket, he has written so much. Woh kabhi kabhar tweet karta hai ki mera yeh project tha, ab iska product ban gaya hai. Matlab crazy level. One of the people jinko main bolta hoon ki Twitter pe recommend karo, one is Jarred, founder of Bun. Crazy in-depth, usko shayad system ka jitna in-depth hai na, nobody... matlab uske jo normal tweets hote hain, they are full of advices. Uski ek advice ne Prisma ki direction change kar di. Prisma removed Rust just on his advice and they are doing good now. Aur ek hai Vercel ka CEO. Worth following them. They are really, really good. Toh haan ji. Ab inko kya hi advice dein? Mann bhar gaya. Dekho agar aapka mann bhar gaya hai, toh aap product bana lo. Aur agar aapka jeevan accha chal raha hai na, toh aap ek B2C SaaS bana lo. Phir uske baad toh jeevan mein kalesh hi kalesh hai. B2B SaaS mein itne nahi hain. B2C SaaS mein bahut kalesh hai. Uske baad maza bhi bahut aayega. Paisa pata nahi kitna kama paoge, nahi kama paoge. But haan, life exciting hogi. At least job acchi lagne lag jayegi phir.",
        "Haan, is Flutter a good choice to get into mobile dev? Dekho yaar, Flutter se maine bahut saalon pehle ek baar course ke liye panga liya tha. Bas, that's it. Uske baad mujhe nahi maza aata usmein yaar. Woh bahut kuch kaam karwata yaar extra. Too opinionated, I think, right? Too opinionated aur pata nahi kyun but mujhe Flutter ka UI aate hi na, I sense something artificial. Matlab, it's too smooth. It's too good. Material UI on steroids. Haan. Toh that's why I don't like it. These days I would fully say, kyunki hum kaam bhi kar rahe hain, toh Expo is worth exploring yaar. Expo guys don't pay me or anything but it's a good product, good tech. Aap Expo explore karke dekho. You will be still in your JavaScript, TypeScript ecosystem. Aur aap apne Tailwind ecosystem mein bhi rahoge. Toh you'll do really good there.",
        "Sir, we can, can we get one shot full backend on GoLang? I want to know the approach and opinion of regarding the docs and doing new projects like an internship. Yaar Go pe main bana toh doon, par usko dekhega kaun? Aapke English channel pe hai sir, already ek Go ki series. Haan, kabhi kabhar woh ekdam se beech mein popular hui thi jab US mein bahut saari Go ki opportunities aayi thi aur pata nahi kisi do-teen companies ne internal docs mein bhej diya tha. Tab acchi viewership aayi thi uspe, uske baad gayab ho gaya. And by the way, mera bhi ek video rakha hua hai. Hopefully jaldi publish karenge. Main bhi pata hai, coincidence aisa raha. Tumne ek channel pe video banaya tha na authentication ka recently, kya banaya tha? OpenFGA. Yes, OpenFGA. And coincidentally, maine bhi usi din ek video banaya. Okay. That was on the same topic. Toh phir maine usko rok diya. Maine kaha, isko nahi publish karta hoon. That... OpenFGA use kar rahe hain. Nahi, kar nahi rahe. But what happened is, main ek book padh raha tha aise hi baithe-baithe hi. Tumhein pata hi hai mere paas kitne subscription hain books ke. Aur usmein main padh raha tha Supabase ke baare mein. Kyunki tumhein pata hai aajkal Supabase humne poora andar se bahar kar rakha hai. Toh Supabase ka jo founder hai na, he has written something on the OpenFGA. Okay. And Supabase ke andar bhi usne usko related leke bahut saara kaam kiya hai. Toh wahan se main uska article padhte-padhte, uske baare mein jaante hue, I landed up there. Aur phir maine uska jo opinion hai ki kis tarah se woh Firebase mein implement karte hain kyunki Firebase runs on just one system. Firebase ka tum dekhoge na, toh it's just a one big EC2 machine. Tumhein bhi, tum jitne machine spin karte ho na instance, it's a sub-instance in that. Toh tum jab DB connect karte ho na TablePlus ya kisi mein, toh tumhein woh Amazon ka link dikhta hai. Woh same hi jagah se jaata hai. Okay. Toh there... controller... haan. Toh there I was studying this aur tab maine explore kara, toh I prepared the whole docs and everything. Phir main usko record karne baith hi raha tha. Utne mein phir tumhara video wahan pe, aaj nahi karte isko.",
        "Oh, toh theek hai. Matlab, you, matlab aapka wala opinion tha. Matlab you could have done. Abhi record kar liya kya sir aapne? Ab karunga. Ab now I wanted, I wanted to give some break on that. Kyunki matlab dekho, cheezein utni hi hain. Ab tum batao, main bataoon, usko 10 foreign ke YouTubers bhi batayenge. Hum bhi batayenge. We have different experience. Unka alag experience, tumhara alag take hai. But kya hai, immediately woh take aayega toh uske baad phir, arre sir copy kar liya, copy kar liya. But everybody lands on that from different lane. Accha hai. OpenFGA hai. Matlab we have used it on a decent scale. Toh usmein bas modeling hai sir. Woh modeling ka kya hai? It's a mindset. Agar ek baar woh modeling karna aa gaya, then you are good to go. Woh shuru mein samajh hi nahi aata kya models banaoon. Database mein jaise modeling hota hai, right? Hum sikhate hain ki kya tables, normalization kaise karte hain. Bas wahi wala, woh ek different approach hai. Us approach ko samajhna padta hai. Toh woh bada acche se unhone Supabase, matlab mujhe itna accha implementation aur itna accha approach kahin nahi dikha jitna us book mein mujhe dikha. I think do ya teen pages hain bas. That's it. But us book mein woh Supabase ke, isliye hi book hai actually mein, specially. Us book ko kisi ne nahi padha. Kisi ne buy nahi kara. Woh subscription mein rakhi hui hai, woh O'Reilly ki book hai ek. Okay. Toh... I didn't new ki Supabase ke upar bhi book hai. Nobody knows it. Woh kahin bikti bhi nahi hai. Tab maine padha tha, uske andar mujhe ek chapter mila. Toh in case jo log janna chahte hain ki hum kahan se padhte hain, kya hota hai, this is how we land up on some really interesting, deep tech ki hum kuch bana rahe the, humein kahin se kuch use hua. Ab Piyush directly land kar gaya wahan pe. Oh yes, nice. Mere paas aajkal offline books nahi hain. Main yeh show off kar sakta hoon bas. But I have a device dedicated for reading, yeh wala. Hum, Google Pixel, nice. And all thanks to Google. Thank you yaar, Google. First, unhone hi send kiya hai. Par it's not a gift, aisa bolna matlab policies mein hai. Main bol nahi sakta it's a gift.",
        "Nahi but sir, yeh toh hai. Matlab, there are lot of resources. Matlab agar koi mere se poochta hai na, what are your resources of learning, matlab bahut zyada hai, internet hi poora resource hai. Kuch cheezein Google se deta hai, kuch cheez ChatGPT references de deta hai, right? Kuch cheez sir aisa hota hai ki jab aap kisi se baat karte ho, you get some words. Phir tumhein curiosity ho jaati hai. Phir tum search karte ho. You get, matlab it's like a graph. Ek cheez search karo, you get four links, you get four links and then you are... Do-teen logon ko baitha do aur tech discussion mein aap bas sirf points note down karo ki aaj kaun se naye word pakad mein aaye. And that's it. You will become much more technical than that.",
        'Ek aur cheez hoti hai, like, sabke saath hoti hai. I am sure, jab hum kisi cheez ko padh rahe hote hain na sir, humein apne aas paas wahi cheezein dikh rahi hoti hain. For example, maine randomly yeh book li. Ismein ek chapter tha "Back of the Envelope Calculation" jiske upar abhi maine last video banaya tha. Toh suddenly I realized ki jo main apne sir se baat karta hoon, unhone bhi aajkal mere se aise baat kiya like, "We need a back of the envelope calculation." Client ka email aaya that "We need a back of the envelope calculation." All random. Matlab abhi maine padhna shuru kiya ya toh main isko notice kar raha hoon. Maybe yeh words pehle bhi aate the. Tum notice kar rahe ho kyunki abhi kal bhi hum jab baat kar rahe the ki hum apni API calls count kar rahe the, we were doing the same thing. Yes, ya, we were doing the same thing. And I was like... humne usko name nahi liya bas but we were doing. Hum utna hi calculation kar rahe the ki kitni API calls pe kitna bill apna baith raha hai. Kitna hum afford kar sakte hain. Hum, nice.',
        'Ek aur super chat. JECRC se MCA kar raha hoon. Nice yaar. Mere ko bhi kaafi din... college hai na sir? Yes. And luckily I am super blessed ki is college ne sort of mujhe alumni status diya actually mein. And main abhi bhi jaata hoon. Dean talks to me really nice. Feels very privileged. In fact, the Chancellor of college, he always, always says, "Hitesh, knock karke seedha aa jao, coffee order karke. Coffee order hi karte hue aana seedhe." And they have truly given me a status of alumni. Mera jo original college hai jahan se maine graduation kari, they don\'t even know about me ki main unke college se bhi hoon. Aisa hi hota hai sir. Matlab mera bhi jo apna college hai wahan pe toh sir PHP aati hai, nahi aati. PHP seekh ke aao. Unko toh pata bhi nahi main exist karta hoon. But really happy ki JECRC, good. Haan, coming to your question. MERN only, kuch guide. Guide yahi hai ki dekho, sirf MERN ka basic se nahi hoga. You need to show off. You need to build some stuff on top of that. AI seekh sakte ho aur accha hai. Aa jao hamare cohort mein. Nahi mann hai, koi baat nahi. Aapke paas YouTube pe bhi accha content hai. You need to upgrade. Aur MERN ke baad, first recommendation main kisi ko deta hoon na, jump into any one database. Aapko MERN ka ek alag level ka perspective pata lagega ki accha, yeh bhi ho sakta tha. Agar MongoDB choose kar rahe ho, MongoDB aggregation pipeline. Agar aap Postgres choose kar rahe ho, learn to join the tables and massive scaling of the table. But DB mein jaate hi pata lagta hai ki full stack aata hai ki nahi aata hai.',
        "Oh nice. Next one is for you, Piyush. I am 6+ year experienced in frontend dev. Should I go for GenAI? I think you should go because GenAI kuch aisa nahi hai ki sirf backend ke log karte hain. Right? Gen... hamara... I think tumhare liye toh perfect hai. Agar 6 saal ho gaye na code likhte hue, this is ideal course for you. Aur and tumhein JavaScript ke andar experience hai because you said frontend developer. Toh sir mujhe lagta hai jisko JavaScript aati hai na, usmein frontend-backend wala boundary hai hi nahi. JavaScript aata hai, tum frontend bhi ho, backend bhi ho. Matlab frontend kya hai? Tumhein bas mere se zyada acchi CSS likhni aati hai. Dekho, JavaScript ke saath jo bhi saal bhar bhi kaam kar raha hai na, usne banaye hain to-dos. Backend bhi, frontend bhi, sab banaye. He happened to choose frontend. Yes. Aur maybe opportunities aisi hui ki hum frontend mein hi zyada gaye. That is the only case. Oh nice.",
        "Sir, Python Chai Code 3 when will you launch? Yaar abhi JS mein kar lete hain. JS ka first batch. Technically, first nahi bol sakte hum kisi bhi batch ko. But let's just say ki what, ki yeh hamara GenAI JS ka toh first hi batch hai. Toh dekhte hain. Humesha aisi queries aati hai na sir, Python ke time pe JavaScript ki queries aur JavaScript ke time mein Python ki queries. Matlab hamare liye it's not very difficult. In case aap bhi dekhoge toh moving from JS to Python, Python to JS, it's just syntax. Foundation wahi hai yaar, itna zyada kuch changes nahi aata. Foundation toh wahi rehte hain. Aur libraries ki acchi baat yeh hai ki they are supporting it like going extended mile into both languages. JavaScript walon ke saath fayda yeh hai ki tum logon ko na Vercel bhi support karta hai. Vercel ke jo AI SDK hai na, they are a charm actually. Matlab bill zyada lete hain. No doubt. Mereko JavaScript sir, matlab mujhe accha lagta hai. The reason is, number one, async support out... jo main, out of the box hai. Pata nahi, samajh humein acche se aati hai. That is the thing. Matlab aap toh sir Python ke saath work karte hue bhi, it's been 8 to 9 months. But still, I love JavaScript in that. And sir, JavaScript ki queue system, distribution aur inki API infrastructure kaafi accha hai. Toh woh cheez hai. Toh that is the thing I love. But haan, Python ke apne sir, matlab jahan pe kahin file parsing vagera karni pade, wahan pe Python really shines. And I think agar ek developer hai na sir aaj ke time mein, if we talk about today, you are, and you are on backend, you should know JavaScript and Python because hai, woh dono hi chahiye actually.",
        "Ab jaise hum bhi bana rahe hain na, we are heavy, abhi hum jo product bana rahe hain, I think within September we will try to launch it. That is heavily on JavaScript. But humne quickly na, humein chota sa ek tool chahiye tha, we quickly switched on, tumne shayad FastAPI mein kiya, I think. Yes, yes. He quickly moved on. Woh JavaScript mein bhi ho sakta tha but happened to choose FastAPI kyunki woh quickly build ho gaya. Dockerized container kara, that's it. Throw up in a DigitalOcean server, that's it. Ready out of the box. Toh humein Python bhi aati hai, JavaScript bhi aati hai. Enjoying the best of both worlds. Aaj ki date mein toh main fresher ko bhi yahi recommend karunga. Seekh lo yaar dono languages. Dono Chai aur Code pe rakhi hui hain, freely available hain.",
        "In fact sir, humne kahin-kahin jagah pe humne na ek RPC pattern kiya hua hai queue mein. Usmein hum kya karte hain? Like it's a, let's say, JavaScript API server running. Sir, kuch aisa task aaya ki sirf itna task mujhe, you know, Python ko offload karna hai. But mujhe isko synchronously karna hai. Like, you know, jaise, let's say sir, aapko ek file read karna hai. But read karne ke baad us text ka aapko JavaScript mein use karna hai. Toh hum kya karte hain, usko RPC pe bhejte hain with a queue and we keep on polling. And jaise hi result aata hai yeh Python mein process hoke and then JavaScript continues. Woh itna seamless ho chuka hai ki pata nahi lagta ki kaun si cheez ab Python mein jaake, you know, it's just a pipeline. Haan, queue mein jaane... aur aajkal dekho queue system bahut acche aa gaye hain. It's not just Redis queue. Agar aap acche queue system ki aur inki baat karoge na, jo background processing hai, jaise Ingest is one of them, beautiful. Aur uske alawa agar aapko open source mein dekhna hai, Mosha, recently aaj unhone shayad apna Docker bhi release kara. I am working with them closely. Toh recently abhi unhone Docker poora apna push kara hai. Just one Docker command and you can fully utilize them, like open source queueing system. It's a very heavy backend. Aap apna workload off kar lo wahan pe, aap queueing system manage kar lo, polling kar lo, steps aap poore use kar lo. Whichever you want to use, aapko Ingest use karna hai, Ingest karo, Mosha use karna hai, Mosha use karo, but super easy now.",
        "Oh nice. Next one. Hello sir, I want to learn data science but I am wondering should I buy the DS course now or wait for the next one? Yaar dekho, main toh yahi kahunga, abhi wale mein hi chal jao kyunki cheezein na, itni baad ke liye jab chhodte hain na, woh kabhi bhi execute hoti nahi hai. And I think agar aapko Python aati hai thodi bahut, toh aap jaldi, quickly cover up bhi kar sakte ho. Aapko I think maths wala part thoda sa dekhna padega wahan pe. Uske baad machine learning toh abhi recently hi start hua hai. Kyunki abhi tak humne sirf Python, NumPy, Pandas, stats, probability, inhi sab pe khatam kiya hai. Ab I think machine learning start hua hai. Toh you should go for this, yaar. Abhi le loge aur kar loge na jitna bhi, toh woh ho jaayega. Bharose mein baithe... humne bahut saare aise dekhe the DSA ke andar bhi, GenAI ke andar bhi, humein aake unhone cohort mein bataya ki sir, main soch raha tha loon, loon. Sochte-sochte ek mahina ho gaya, last wala batch nikal gaya, toh hum second batch mein aa gaye. Ab, ab at least ho gaya. Toh ho jaata hai yaar usi time pe. Nice. Okay.",
        'Ek aur, "Sir, maine aapse JS seekh kar abhi backend kar raha hoon. Maine khud ka product ke liye. But mera job karne ka bhi mann hai. Kya meri job lag sakti hai?" Bilkul lag sakti hai. Meri ek problem hai ki main bhoolta bahut hoon. Arre, welcome to my ground. Kaun yaad rakhta yaar? Coding pata hai, kabhi kuch yaad rakhne ki cheez thi hi nahi aur na abhi hai. It\'s just knowing the routes, ki un raaston pe pahuncha kaise jaata hai. Kisi ko matlab, humne shayad 10on baar, 20on baar, har cohort mein hi likhte hain hum authentication vagera. Par yaad thodi na rehta hai abhi bhi. We just know how to reach there. We know the flow. Haan, that is, I think poora software engineering is all about knowing the flow. Jitna aapko flow samajh mein aayega na, that is it. Uske baad nahi farak padta, Postgres hai, MySQL hai, MongoDB hai. The syntax is same, wahi loops, wahi function, wahi objects.',
        "Actually, ek aur cheez hai sir. Like he said na, main bhoolta bahut hoon. I think practice kam hai. Jab aap kisi cheez ko baar-baar repeat mein kar lete ho, right, woh eventually yaad ho jaati hai. Matlab hum jaan boojh ke yaad nahi kar rahe hain. Woh cohorts pe padha kar and implement kar kar ke, I think woh ho gaya hai yaad. Woh muscle memory ban chuki hai ek tarah ki. Toh I think that is the thing.",
        "Ek do cheezein main hamesha recommend karta hoon ismein, ki at least ek complete authentication system from scratch, jismein reset password, validation, yeh woh sab, at least aapne teen se chaar baar banaya hua hona chahiye. Delete it, recreate it. Delete it, recreate it. Woh thoda ajeeb lagega aapko ki yaar, yeh bhi koi cheez hai? But it actually works. Aur at least ek full stack project aapne do baar banaya hua hona chahiye, minimum two times. Same project, not new project. Same project aapne do baar banaya, then you will get the details of it. Agar yeh kar loge, toh phir aapki shikayatein door ho jaati hai. Tha... wahi hai na, itna patience kiske paas hai ki sir, yeh project ban toh gaya hai na, ab kuch aur banaunga, ab yeh nahi banaunga. Woh banaya hua project agar dobara bana liya na, toh I don't think so uske baad tumhein meri bhi zaroorat hai ya kisi bhi tutorial ki zaroorat hai. That's true sir. Main bhi jab coding seekh raha tha na, matlab I learned mainly ki main apne seniors ka code rewrite karta tha. Ki jo mere seniors ne likha, after the office hours, main usko rewrite karke dekhunga. Toh ek habit ban jaati hai. Simple hai, hands-on ke bina nahi ho payega. Jitna marzi you... woh DHH ki, DHH ki line ekdam sahi hai woh. You learn from your fingers? Yes. Coding, music, whatever it is, maths, you learn from your fingers. Nice.",
        'As a frontend dev, should I take the GenAI JS or Python? Dekho, agar JavaScript likhte ho na... Dekho, mera yeh goal kehne ka ki aapko ek to-do app basic banayi hui honi chahiye ya phir aapka ek frontend, yeh hai JavaScript ke saath experience, uska context samajhna zaroori hai. Uska context yeh hai ki aapko JavaScript mein hands-on experience hai kya? Dekho, ek hota hai ki sir maine videos dekhe hain. Toh woh experience nahi hai ki maine videos dekhe hain. Ek hai ki sir, maine aapke saath-saath kuch build kiya hai, either on frontend, either on backend, or any one of them. But haan, mujhe dar nahi lagta. Agar aap mujhe kahoge ki is value ko utha ke us file mein le aao, is value ko utha ke is file mein le aao ya utha ke isko kisi DB mein rakh do, DB se wapas le aao. Yeh sab cheezein agar aapko flow samajh mein aata hai na in general, then you are ideal candidate for this. Agar aap maan lo abhi first year mein aaye ho, thoda DSA ki problem solve karte ho, thoda bahut JavaScript aata hai, toh nahi hai. Toh yeh course aapke liye nahi hai. Kyunki abhi aapne sirf LeetCode ki problems dekhi hai thodi si. Aapne thoda sa JavaScript... kyunki uske baad kya hoga, hamare first batch ki tarah, haan, yeh bilkul soch ke mat aana ki aapko ek project file denge. Is project ko aap apne HOD ko de doge. HOD aapki peeth thap-thapayega, "Waah beta, tum toh AI ke bahut bade dhurandhar nikle. Ab main tumhein degree aise laake ghar..." Aisa mat karna. Us cheez ke liye cohort nahi hai. This is mainly for people jo ab next step pe jaana chahte hain ki theek hai yaar, woh basic to-do ho gaya apna. Frontend pe aap jo kehte ho React, iska, idhar ka, flexible vagera, mobile, woh sab main kar leta hoon ab. Ab batao, next update kya ho sakta hai life mein? Modern ke, modern tech ke hisaab se. Toh unke liye yeh perfect course hai. Toh agar aap apne aap ko koi sa bhi dev bolte ho na, frontend dev, full-stack dev, backend, if you call yourself as a dev, then it is for you. Agar you call yourself as a learner, beginner, fresher, jisko easy way mein, toh phir nahi hai. Aapka bhi time kharab hoga, hamara bhi hoga.',
        'Actually first cohort mein humein pata hai kya problem aayi thi? Sir, jab maine pehla Python ka code likha, imports mein problem aa gayi ki yeh import kaise kiya. Toh utna basics toh aana chahiye. Matlab nahi toh phir woh GenAI ka nahi, woh ek language cohort ban jaayega. You should have a proper hold on the language. Ki haan, callback function agar kahin likh diya toh you should not be like, "Arre yeh kya kar diya, callback function kya hota hai?" Nahi, callback function aata hai, baaki cheezein hum sikhayenge. Haan, baaki logic, flow and everything, woh hum sikhayenge. But wahi hai ki agar aap bologe, "Sir, yeh named import kya hai, yeh export kyun hua, yeh export default kyun hua?" Toh phir nahi, phir hum kisi aur cohort mein milenge. Woh web cohort hai.',
        'Haan, main abhi soch bhi raha tha Piyush, ki web jo second cohort hai, I think ek mailing list hum open kar sakte hain. Yes, request toh hai sir, kaafi saari. Toh main soch raha tha ki ek mailing list open kar dein. But wahi main soch raha tha, should we do just like a plain mailing list? Kyunki uska toh koi sense hai nahi. There are no serious people. Koi bhi email drop karke chala jaayega, you don\'t know about that. Maybe if we can open up like a small ticket price or something. Ki if you are really serious about it, token money, kuch ₹60 ya kuch, isse chota-mota, zyada nahi. Toh maybe we can offer them like insane, crazy discount taaki jo aapne initial apna enroll kiya hai ₹50-₹60 deke, jo bhi, toh that means you have shown your good intention ki haan, hum abhi se serious hain and we want... toh unke liye kuch crazy discount ho sakta hai. I was thinking on that perspective. Itne mein hi sir, woh filter out ho jaayega, right? Haan, kyunki dekho, koi bhi hoga jisko sirf time pass karna hai, woh email toh drop kar dega. But agar aap wahan pe ₹6, ₹10 bhi laga dete ho na ki woh UPI app open hogi, tab bhi log phir kehte hain, "Nahi, nahi..." Toh I think we should do something like this. At least... Let\'s ask the chat, kitna ticket price rakhna chahiye? 50, 60, 100, ya whatever. Poll karte hain, poll. I love polling. Ispe hota hai poll. Haan, main YouTube window bhi khol ke rakhta hoon. Accha, maine kabhi try hi nahi kiya. Filter out toh karna zaroori hai. Bina filter out kare toh... chaar option denge. Kaun Banega Crorepati ki tarah? Deviyon aur sajjano, aapke saamne hain chaar option. Fastest finger first. Oh nice. 500 is fair. Ankit bol rahe hain itna kyunki Ankit ka cohort ho chuka hai. Toh Ankit bol rahe... Arre Ankit sir apna woh bata rahe hain, return on first cohort. Oh nice. Abhiraj bol rahe hain, "Hitesh, learning from Udemy course. Create content. Thanks, thanks, thanks." Aur upgrade kar rahe hain. Content pe hum bahut kaam kar rahe hain.',
        'Mereko best messages pata kaunse lagte hain sir? Ki jab woh aata hai ki, "Sir, the cohort was really worth it. Now I am making 20x, 30x of the cohort price." Aaj humne retweet bhi kara woh ek. Yes. Ek project mein hi I think, kitna? 10x, kitna bataya tha maine? Sir, 20x is a... Sir, mera ek friend hai. Toh he is working with a very big company in Canada. Sir, literally, usne kya kiya hai, pata hai. Maine usko nahi kaha tha. Usne aapki live stream dekhi, demo day wali. Sir, usne tweets jaake reach out kiya hai. Sumant, you remember? Jisko we gave a MacBook giveaway. Aur one more guy, Ashu, unko jaake usne khud se reach out kiya ki, "I am Piyush\'s friend." Mujhe nahi pata. Theek hai? "We are looking out for developers. Humne aapka project dekha." Aur sir, woh saamne se ek hi reply aaya usko, "Hum already place ho chuke hain. Thanks for the offer." Maine kaha, this is the next thing. Kyunki matlab, un students ke liye this is the worth thing ki saamne se offer bhi aa raha hai aur woh khud pehle hi place hoke baithe hain.',
        "Nice. Nice. Yeh bhi accha hai Kartik ka ki 50% advance cohort price. Yaar dekho, problem pata hai kya hai? I don't want 50% kyunki main advance mein kisi se paisa nahi lena chahta. But the thing is, if we do ₹100 even for that na, toh usmein se bhi 18% government ko dena padega. Toh woh bhi ek issue hai. We need to take care of that. Aur jab aap fees bharoge, usmein se bhi 18% wapas jaayega. Toh uska main kuch nahi kar sakta. That is how it is. But yes, I think mailing list with some pricing actually makes sense. Toh theek hai. Abhi hamare paas poll ke result bhi aa gaye. Chaliye end karte hain. Toh 60% keh rahe hain under 100. But we have 18% also audience jo keh rahe hain 100. 13% hamare paas 200+ bhi hai aur 7% under 200. Toh I really like the percentage jo keh rahe hain 200+. Toh yeh jo 13% audience hain out of 564 votes, they are really dead serious. Hum. Ki nahi, we want to do it. And this time, toh we are very much planned and equipped. Hamara MasterJi, internal platform, it's so much ready. It will track every single assignment, it will track every single peer assignment, aur hamare paas kitne aap article likh rahe ho, kya aapka response hai, aap technical writing mein weak ho, ki aap code likhne mein weak ho, ki aap community mein weak ho, everything we are tracking like anything. And we now have collaborations also. Woh hum cohort ke time pe announce karenge. First cohort mein humne announce nahi kara tha just because ki humein laga tha ki us type ke audience ko attract nahi karte hain. Otherwise, agar hum giveaway vagera sab kuch announce kar dete ki kitna giveaway aur yeh sab jaa raha hai, we could have easily doubled the audience. But this time, toh ab baat open ho hi gayi hai ki haan, cohort mein giveaways hote hain. MacBook bhi hai, iPhone bhi hai, cash prizes toh jaate hi jaate hain. And overall it's a good community learning experience. Aisa nahi hai ki aap cohort se hi sab kuch karoge. Aap bina cohort bhi kar loge. Aisi koi badi baat nahi hai. Aapko agar likhna hai, seekhna hai, aap kahin se bhi kar loge. But yahan sirf itna sa hai ki woh gati badh jaati hai. It increases your speed. That's all.",
        "Okay. Aur bhi super chats hain. Oh nice. Sir, please talk about Lee Robinson. Lee ne pivot kiya hai. I really like the pivot of Lee. Tumne dekha Lee ka naya pivot? Yes sir. I can't even imagine. Mujhe laga tha he is like a second owner of the Vercel. I really like the guy, actually. Takes the responsibility. Aisa feel karwana logon ko ki I am the next owner, that means he takes that much of responsibility of the product yaar. Right? Aur aur acchi baat ki CEO ne itni authority dene bhi di ki take it as just like your own company. Like on both sides, this is really good. I think he was from very beginning, matlab kaafi initial day... He was in the founding team. Ya. Aur kaafi unhone contribute bhi kiya and everything. And then I think, somehow, mujhe lag gaya tha kahin na kahin, jis hisaab se unke videos aa rahe the na, Lee ke, I realized ki this guy actually enjoys teaching more. This guy loves to make videos yaar. Like har ek video mein ek precision hai, ek cuts hai, ek smile hai. He enjoys the thing. That is very rare. Kyunki padhate bahut hain chup-chaap. Haan, theek hai, ho gaya video khatam. But the way how he enjoys talking to people. He pinged me also and talked and... toh mujhe laga yaar, this guy, why doesn't he do like content full time. He could be a good streamer, like Primeagen and all of that. Toh, like, why not? And eventually, theek hai, probably, he don't want to go full in this route because is, is route mein actually mein paise kam hain. To be honest. Aur agar main aapko fairly bataoon na, even in our cohort, logon ko lagta hai it's a good money and everything. But if you look at the infrastructure, the cost, the Zoom license, the TA fees and everything, aur jo poora amount aata hai, it's splitted into six months. Toh agar aap divide by six karte ho usko, toh me and Piyush, we both make more than that through the jobs and through the consulting gigs. Toh that is the one. Abhi hum yahi toh kar rahe hain. Otherwise we would have launched another cohort. But sirf cohort se paisa nahi banta na. Problem yeh hai. You have to earn your living through the tech job that we are doing. Toh that's why usko rest leke yahan pe bhi seriously kaam karna zaroori hai. Sumanta is here. Oh, Sumanta is here. Oh, he is in the super chat. Nice. Sir, just joined, meeting pe rehte-rehte khud ka naam suna. Nice man. Nice. Sumanta actually gave his probably more than 100%. He was there and he got them... interview. Yes. Ya, he was there in platform, every class. Haan. Kuch log the unka track record aur yeh sab dekhne ko mila. He was in every single class. He was pinging me constantly, to Piyush. All the TAs knows him. Koi na, class mein aaoge toh theek hai, pata chal hi jaata hai. Okay, nice.",
        "Mohan Roy got a $12... $200 per month remote full stack dev job from a startup. Batao yaar, tumhara podcast, interview karta hoon yaar. Views acche aate hain yaar us... Tier 3 college, aur tumne title bhi de rakha hai. Tier 3 college earns $1200 per month. That's it, title. Still... keywords... Still I am not there yet. What should I focus to grow more in my career? Pehle toh mere podcast pe aao tum yaar. Ek launch karna padega aisa hi podcast. Phir meri growth hogi pehle toh. But nahi. Agar dekho yaar, honestly bataoon, agar tumhein lag raha hai na ki $1200 per month remote full stack mein tumhein agar feel stuck hai, toh I think you can achieve more. Kabhi kabhar internally aapko potential apna pata hota hai ki I can do more for it. But main yeh kahin se recommend nahi karunga ki isko chhod ke aap kuch aur karo. Keep that money come in aur yeh jo remote ka aapke paas accha khasa offer hai. Try to increase while having this. Aur kitna aap workload handle kar rahe ho. Kitni aur opportunities, kyunki is tarah ke remote roles mein na ek hi disadvantage hai ki aapki networking utni strong nahi banti jitni aapki in-office ban jaati hai. Toh you have to compensate somewhere on that part. But again, wahi hai ki agar aapka jo bhi kaam kar rahe ho, try to explore more. Backend kar rahe ho, frontend explore karo. Full stack kar rahe ho, GenAI explore karo. GenAI explore kar liya hai, maybe try for DSA and FAANG. But na, ek cheez aapko batata hoon sabhi ko, you probably guys don't know this, even FAANG job ka career na bada nahi hota hai. People don't realize it but aapko shayad idea nahi hai, itne acche offices, itne acche coffee station, itna accha premises ki aap in day in a software engineer bana rahe ho, phir sab log chhodte kyun hain? All time hiring kyun ho rahi hai? Attrition hai, log jaa rahe hain. Wahan par na, jo higher level pe log hain, woh sirf isliye ruke hue hain kyunki unke stocks jo hain, woh dilute hone wale hain. Kal unke stocks dilute karo, woh parson nahi aayenge. Aur jinke lag raha hai ki nahi yaar, apna bhar gaya hai. Aap dekho na, mujhe hardly kisi ka 4 saal ka bhi career nahi dikha hai. Agar FAANG end destination hai, toh 4 saal se zyada career kyun nahi hai wahan pe? Toh think about it. Main yeh nahi keh raha FAANG kharab hai kahin se bhi. FAANG is still good. It's one of the best badge of honor you can carry. But it's not you. Your job cannot be you. My college cannot be me. Agar main poori zindagi yahi thappa leke ghoom raha hoon na, main IIT se hoon, main ITS se hoon. I have done seriously wrong with my life. Ki main us level se kabhi badh hi nahi paya ki maine 12th ke andar jo exam diya tha, main aaj bhi usi ko carry karke ghoom raha hoon. Ya phir maine college ke baad ek jo interview crack kara tha, main aaj bhi usi ko leke ghoom raha hoon. This should never be your talk. Like agar Vercel ka CEO aaj bhi yahi kehta hai ghume, maine, maine socket banaya, socket banaya. I think that should not be the case. Right now he talks about the Vercel and achievement. That is beautiful. Agar Lee Robinson ki hum baat kar rahe hain, toh hum yeh baat nahi karte ki Lee Robinson IIT se tha ya woh Caltech se tha ya phir usne ek baar FAANG crack kiya tha. His talk should be, he enjoys his work, he has taken Vercel on to the next level. That is what I personally love. But again, yeh sab cheezein thoda baad mein samajh aati hai when you hit that maturity, when you hit that level. Toh abhi ke liye lagega, nahi nahi, faaltu baat hai, FAANG is everything. Matlab theek hai, woh hota hai sir mindset. Nahi, woh mindset sir ek saath change hota hai sir. Kisi time pe sir mere liye 10th ke exams bahut maayne rakhte the ki agar yeh na hua toh pata nahi kya hoga zindagi mein, right? Phir woh cheez plus two pe aayi, uske baad phir woh college pe aati hai. Then phir first internship kitni matter rakhti, I, I remember, first internship aisa lagta tha ki sir agar yeh poori nahi ki six months toh pata nahi kya ho jaayega. Toh I think woh cheezein theek hai, matlab you are at that age and we are at that age ki woh FAANG abhi itna bada nahi lag raha. Ek time pe mujhe bhi lagta tha ki you know, Google and Amazon aur everything. Yes, aur is baar toh mujhe bahut hi kharab laga ki I had to deny even the invitation from Google. Is baar ka Google I/O tha because of other... Agar yeh matlab 10 saal pehle aaya hota, I would have done anything, but I would not have denied it. But is baar mujhe sadly aur unki taraf se do-do, teen call aa rahe the, \"Yaar aa jao na yaar, aise kya kar... yaar pakka next time aaunga.\" Toh probably that time has passed, probably, whatever.",
        'Oh nice. Bahut saare super chat ho gaye. Thoda sa fast-fast lete hain kyunki dekho yaar, paisa bhara hai toh inko toh jawab dena banta hai. Okay, haan, yeh, yeh question I would love to take this. "Sir, maine Python wala GenAI course liya tha. Do I need to buy this?" Absolutely no. Absolutely no. Agar aapne kaise bhi Python ka GenAI wala ya woh wale batch liye hain, aapko yeh batch lene ki bilkul zaroorat nahi hai. Don\'t get into FOMO or anything kyunki jo concepts hain na, woh aapko dobara se, agar haan, live padhne ka mann hai and everything, that you can decide. But content-wise, aapko aisa kuch extraordinary, yeh nahi hoga. Obvious si baat hai, thodi cheezein jo nayi hai, humne is dauran seekh li hai, woh toh hum discuss karenge hi. But to be honest, you will not get much value that we can actually deliver. Toh aap please mat hi kharido. We are not here just to sell ki nahi nahi, le lo, le lo, kisi ko bhi. Aap please mat lijiye. Haan, itni imandari se hum karte hain baat.',
        "Haan, haan, mujhe pata hai. Yeh bhi mujhe karna hai. Is course ka number hi nahi aa raha hai. Is course ki bahut demand chal rahi hai. JS, DSA with JS. Accha, DSA with JS ki khaas baat yeh hai ki this doesn't open up throughout the year. Aur ismein cohort mein bhi aisa nahi hai ki hum 500-600 log lete hain. We don't take it. Hum maximum 200 par toh intake rok hi dete hain. Sharp, straight. Nahi lene isse zyada student. Toh this is one of the thing. Aur isiliye yeh course abhi tak itna premium hai.",
        "Okay. Piyush se hai next. Piyush, Piyush se poochna chahte hain. \"Piyush bhaiya, BCA kar raha hoon. Please mujhe guide, planning MCA.\" Dekho yaar, na toh BCA koi value carry karti hai, na MCA, na B.Tech. What carries is ki bhai tumne un chaar saalon mein college se hatke kya kiya hai? Maine BCA, MCA... kyunki pehli baat main commerce background se tha. Doosri baat, lockdown tha. Aur teesri baat, mereko 50% off mil raha tha college ki taraf se ki theek hai yaar, tumne kaunsa college aana hai? Lockdown chal raha hai. 50% off le lo. Isliye maine toh maze-maze mein kar li. Agar college aapka time waste kar raha hai just because you are doing MCA, toh bhai it's not worth it. Agar ghar baithe ho jaati hai, right? Matlab tumhein ek time mil jaata hai apni skill development pe, toh that carries more value. Toh theek hai, apni BCA kar lo because I think, phir bhi sir, hai na, ek bachelor degree hona zaroori hai, varna woh ek plus two tag reh jaayega. Toh ek BCA toh kar lo. You have a bachelor degree. MCA agar tumhara time allow karta hai, that's okay, but I don't think so it's really worth it. Usse accha tum kisi internship mein chale jaana uske baad.",
        'Dekho yaar, I personally think ek graduation degree aapke paas honi chahiye. Whatever is the bachelor degree. B.Com ho, BCA ho, B.Tech ho, I don\'t care about that. But ek proper, validatable, accreditable graduation degree zaroori hai. Yeh aapko aaj pay nahi karega. But honestly bataoon, kya hota hai? Kai baar aapko acche offers hain ya phir aap already kisi company mein kaam kar rahe ho. Aur tab aate hain compliances. Kyunki aisa nahi hai. Dekho, startup ke andar kisi ki bhi salary kuch bhi ho sakti hai. No problem at all. But aap jab compliance level ki company mein jaate ho, TCS, Infosys aur yeh sab, wahan par aapko ek level ke baad agar package chahiye na, you need to show the proof, not just your work, but aapko degree show karni padti hai. Aur India ke andar jaise Paytm ho gaya ya Phirpe ho gaya. Kyunki unpe koi bhi ek aarop laga sakta hai na, ki isko zyada paise kyun de rahe ho? Toh they need to provide a justification to the court and to wherever the filing is happening. Aur government bhi aapse yeh pooch sakti hai compliances ke baare mein. Shayad dekho, aap students ho, abhi college mein ho, aapko nahi pata ki yeh bhi kya word hota hai compliances. But compliances bahut badi cheez hai. Compliances ki vajah se aapki job jaa bhi sakti hai, jaati hui job bach bhi sakti hai, aapka packages badh bhi sakta hai aur badhta hua wapas bhi aa sakta hai. Sirf aapki skills maayne nahi rakhti. Compliances hoti hai. Toh kuch compliances aisi hoti hai, maan lijiye aap Capgemini mein kaam kar rahe hain, Accenture mein kaam kar rahe hain. Ab aapko on-site ka ek call hai ki you have to go to Australia for 3 months. Lekin Australian company kehti hai, "Show us your graduation degree." Aur woh aapki graduation degree verify bhi karwayegi. Wahan pe agar aap... ho gaye, toh aapko woh on-site offer chhodna padega. Abhi mera ek friend hai, woh Sweden gaya hai. Kyunki uske paas masters degree thi. Woh kaam bhi accha karta hai, no doubt. But woh offer uske paas aaya tha kahin se reject hoke kyunki uske paas masters degree nahi thi. Sweden mein unhone kaha, "We need somebody who has, who holds the masters degree." Toh jiske paas tha, woh accha developer tha. In fact, bahut accha tha, but uske paas sirf graduation degree thi. Uske paas naam ki masters degree thi. Toh woh six month ke liye Sweden gaya hai. Toh yahan pe jab aap atakte ho na, tab bahut bura lagta hai. Kyunki abhi nahi atakoge aap. Experience. Haan, yeh abhi kahin nahi atakoge initial days mein. Atakoge kab? 3 saal baad, 5 saal baad. Jab aap kahoge, "Yaar, ab biwi-bacche vagera sab hai. Ab kahan se main degree karne jaaoon?" Tab us din aapko hoga ki, "Yaar, kar lena chahiye tha yaar. 2 saal zindagi kahan nikal gaye?" Aur acchi, kyunki aapki degree na, verify hoti hai actually mein. Aur verification ke process hain, bahut, actually mein. Aapko bahut apne college se bhi bana ke rakhni padti hai ismein. Jaise agar aap US ki, Tech se kar rahe ho ya NYU se kar rahe ho, toh aapko apne college jaana padta hai. Your college will actually draft your, a degree and a copy of it, marksheets vagera. Uske upar ek woh, aah, seal lagate hain that cannot be broken aur woh unko wahan se degree send karni padti hai. Courier karna padta hai. Toh agar aapki college se acchi nahi banti hai, unhone rok diya toh aapka Caltech ya NYU mein admission tak ruk jaata hai. Toh again, yeh kisse kahani hai. Eventually, experience ke saath aapko pata lag jaati hai kyunki maine dekhe hain yeh sab hote hue. Mere friends ne liye hain admission Caltech mein, NYU mein. Abhi recently Sweden wala case hua. Woh bada khush tha ki, "Sir, pata nahi kahan se meri toh jholi mein aake tapak gaya. Main chala Sweden." Toh kar lo bhai degree.',
        'Hamare, hamare... mujhe toh sir mera degree ke days yaad hi nahi. Sab COVID mein nikal gaya. College life bas six months ki. I think six years, I think one year. Matlab yaad bhi nahi mujhe toh. Toh aise hi kehte-kehte bas aapki, aap BCA ho gayi. Done. Matlab, paper bhi online diye the. Theek hai. Woh kehte hain, "MCA karni hai toh kya doge?" "50% off." "Theek hai, karwa do sir." Thode dino baad, aise lag raha hai, thode dino baad, do saal baad message aaya, "Lo, aapki MCA bhi ho gayi." Ho gayi, theek hai. Woh piece of paper na eventually kaam aate hain. Jaise abhi recently tha, toh abhi just recent ki baat batata hoon ki aap visas jo apply karte ho na, that actually depends on aapne past countries kahan-kahan travel kari hai. Us basis pe aapke visas expand hote jaate hain. Toh abhi just recently, Australia ka, we didn\'t ask for that much of visa. Unhone 3 saal ke liye even de diya ki, "Haan, chill out. Kabhi bhi, multi-entry, aap aao, jaao, chill karo." Australia mein. New Zealand keh rahe hain ki, "Oh, we sent you mini visa this time. Yeh wala khatam, consume karne ke baad, you send us again, we will give you 3 years." Hum... toh wahi hai, eventually you learn ki haan, past ke jo aapke kaam toh nahi kahunga, karm hi kahunga, woh... woh aade aate hain.',
        '"Got JS Dev Job. Struggling with logic. No DSA. Scared of fire." Okay, yeh toh shayad emoji hoga jo mere ismein convert nahi hua. But... yeh likha kaunse usmein hai, tumne kaunse casing use kar rahe ho? Dekho logic-vogic ka simple... DSA se koi logic thodi na aata hai? LeetCode se interview clear karna aata hai. DSA se interview clear karna aata hai. Usse logic-vogic thodi na build hota hai koi. Logic toh ghis ke, project bana ke, baar-baar bana ke, usi se aate hain logic.',
        'Okay nice. Super chat. "Sir, there is no frontend section in Web Dev Udemy." Arre hai yaar, frontend poora ka poora React section hai wahan pe. Thoda neeche hai, backend ke baad mein hai. Dekho jaake. Poore React ke 8 aur 9 projects hain wahan pe. Hai bhai frontend, hai. Thoda sa neeche hai bas. Aur kuch chahiye toh bata do, aur add kar denge, koi problem nahi hai. "Present sir. Just joined..." Accha, Sumant ka toh ho gaya tha. "Sir, quick roadmap on data science and what to master." Hum, dekho data science ke andar Python must hai. Mera Python ka Udemy wala course hai, woh le lo, sabse best hai. Uske baad dekho, NumPy, Pandas mein koi aapko option nahi milega. Aur I think Streamlit mein bhi nahi milega. Yeh NumPy, Pandas, Streamlit, teeno karne hi padenge. Then you can pick any one framework to learn machine learning. You can pick Scikit-learn or you can learn PyTorch as well. Agar aapko core hi machine learning mein jaana hai, then Scikit-learn is your best friend. Agar nahi, toh you can go for PyTorch because that orients more towards deep learning and AI. Toh yeh aapke core foundation hote hain. Aap jo chahe pick kar lo. Aisa nahi hai ki aapko Scikit ke baad hi PyTorch... nahi. You can go directly into PyTorch. Thoda-thoda basic aapko PyTorch ki books mein bhi samjha dete hain ki accha, aisa-aisa kuch-kuch sa woh hota hai machine learning mein. Aa jao yahan pe. Phir aap, toh backpropagation vagera, woh sab sikha dete hain usmein. Toh this is the basic overview of how the roadmap. Ab aap path kahan se choose karte ho? O\'Reilly books are great, Packt books are great. Hamara cohort bhi great hai agar aapko data science vagera ka karna hai toh. And then another side is implementation side. That is your AI. GenAI, agentic AI and woh sab jo hum GenAI wale batch mein karte hain. Toh pick your own poison, which one you like the best. Mujhe itna woh PyTorch, Scikit-learn itna pasand nahi aata hai. PyTorch still I can bear. Scikit-learn toh I can\'t even bear. Toh this is my take.',
        'Okay, "Sir, Cohort 1 student, should take Cohort 2 or not?" Depends. Agar aapko, dekho, mujhe pata hai aapne Cohort 1 mein bahut enjoy kiya hai and mujhe pata hai 100% ki bahut saare Cohort 1 ke student bhi Cohort 2 mein aana chahenge just because woh learning experience, jo hum discussion karte hain, jo assignments milte hain, jo challenges milte hain, jisko hum is baar aur zyada badhayenge. Toh agar uske liye lena hai toh le sakte ho. Otherwise aapko aisi koi need nahi hai. Agar aapko consistency wapas se rakhni hai ya kuch aisa hai toh aap kar sakte ho. Otherwise you don\'t actually need it. Is baar bas hum thode se project aur zyada karenge. Flow thoda sa aur better humne kiya hai is baar aur challenges is baar thode se different take mein hum denge aapko. Toh that is only the thing.',
        "Arre haan, yeh dekha tumne Piyush, Bitchat? Bitchat, sir woh Bluetooth wala, right? Haan. Haan, woh maine dekha tha. I was like ki message pahunchega kaise? Matlab kahan-kahan travel karega? Matlab I think it was that ki if even you are far away from me, matlab if I send you a message, toh mera message kisi aas-paas wale ke paas jaayega. Right? Kab jaayega? Patiala kab pahunchega? Matlab that is the reason na ki sir ismein tum kaunsi graph algorithm laga rahe ho? Breadth first... kaise pahunchega? Matlab, you... matlab memory kitni zyada bhar jaayegi. Mujhe aisa lag raha tha ki my phone as a client, kitnon ke message receive karega? Kitnon ko forward karega? And most fun project. Fun project. But it is actually literally going not from internet, but actually road se jaa raha hai woh message, Patiala se, Jaipur se. By road travel kar raha hai woh.",
        'Toh alright, theek hai Piyush, maine toh aise hi kar liya tha just for chill. You need to go, toh that\'s okay to go. Mom is calling. Okay sir, it was great talking to you all. Okay, bye bye. Bye everyone. Alright. Chalo ji, wapas se aate hain aapki super chat par aur fatafat hum bhi end karte hain. Arre kaafi der ho gayi yaar, ek ghante se bhi upar ho gaya. Chaliye, fatafat ab end karte hain isko. "One year startup, MERN, CI/CD, GenAI. Don\'t know how to switch." Agar dekho, abhi switch nahi kar pa rahe toh jahan ho, wahan raho. Eventually, I think dekho, jaise aap January ke aas-paas dekhoge na, then it will open up a lot of potential options. Toh wahan par bhi aap dekh sakte ho. Remote jobs mein kaafi opportunities open hoti hain Jain ke aas-paas mein. That is usually the time. "Can we build website integrated AI in this cohort?" Haan, agar dekho, websites banana nahi sikhayenge. Agar bani banayi website hai, wahan pe integration hum poora sikhayenge ki AI kis tarah se integrate ho sakta hai. Toh that we definitely are going to learn.',
        'Okay. Next is, "Having 10+ years of experience of Android development experience." Pehli baat, you are on a different league and I know this personally. Ek decade ka experience, especially Android, you are on a different league, man. "I feel overwhelmed by the rapid updates in the Android, I agree, and the rise of AI. How do you decide what to learn next by staying relevant and avoid being left behind?" Dekho yaar, kuch cheezein obvious hoti hai jahan pe I know that they are here to stay. Like, mujhe kabhi bhi aisa Web3, inke liye nahi feel hua ki, "Am I missing something?" Because mostly jo implementation dekhe, maine rug-pull implementation hi dekhe hain. Mostly inflated figures hi dekhe hain jo ki tokens ki format mein hai. There is no real money that anybody is making in the crypto. Woh hype hai. Token money hai but it never converts into real Gandhiji. That is my take. And I would say ki yaar dekho, agar Android mein aapko itna saal ho gaya hai na, agar main aapki jagah pe hota, again, fictitious take. Agar main aapki jagah pe hota, toh what I would say is ki I would have explored more on the mobile ecosystem along with the backend. Full stack mobile developer is very rare, unheard. Toh main definitely backend mein toh dabble karta hi karta, plus I would have moved out of this comfort zone of calling myself as an Android developer. I would rather call myself as a mobile developer. I would explore things like Expo, maybe little bit Flutter, not much, not my cup of tea. But main haan, thoda sa React Native explore karta. Expo explore karta. iOS ecosystem bhi explore karta. Because ab mereko, agar mere experience ke saath meri pricing badhani hai, freelancing work lene hain, toh I definitely need to provide a full solution. I hope you are getting what I am saying. Toh woh full solution main tabhi de paunga jab main backend bhi jaanta hoon. And I can make a really robust, good mobile app. And not just for Android, but rather a complete solution for mobile. iOS, Android, both. Toh bahut easy hai aur kyunki aapko dekho, 10 saal ka core Android experience hai na, toh I think do-teen week se zyada aapko nahi lagega Expo mein transition hone mein. Because you already know ki haan, sound ke liye ek alag se library lagti hai. You need to import things for accessing the sound. Camera implementation aapko already aata hai. Aur jo bhi haptic feedbacks hai, yeh sab hai. Toh aapko ecosystem pata hai. You know that operating system really well. But I would say, definitely ping me up on Twitter as well. 10 saal ke jinko experience hai, I would love to talk with them, chat with them. I would love to keep my DMs always open for you so that you can ping me anytime. Toh please mujhe ek thoda sa reminder daal ke Twitter pe kar dena. I will accept that request and I will definitely love to learn more from you as well.',
        'Okay. "Your job cannot be you." Words of wisdom, sir. Oh nice. Kabhi kabhar bahut acche... Twitter pe isko frame karwa ke please tag kar dena. "Your job cannot be you." "Your exam cannot be you." I think everybody should live by this. Nice. Main hi tweet kar doon kya? Main hi tweet kar deta hoon. Okay, maine hi tweet kar diya hai. Please aap log bhi share kar dena, retweet kar dena. Link de doon aapko bhi? Yeh lijiye. Please retweet, reshare kar dijiyega. This is actually really good.',
        'Okay, next. Chaliye, aur bhi super chat hai, fatafat khatam karein. "Hi sir, I am a Java developer with 4 years of experience. Should I wait for the Python GenAI batch? Also if you can suggest from where I can start with GenAI?" Dekho, agar Java ka itna experience hai toh obvious si baat hai. Aapne thoda bahut frontend, React vagera, yeh sab likha hi hai. Toh I think go for the next GenAI batch. Dekho, live mein cheezein khatam ho jaati hai. Jab live courses hote hain, cohort hote hain na, toh wahan pe over ho jaata hai. Otherwise it is very difficult. Karne ko toh aap dekho, purane batches bhi le sakte ho jo video wale hain, woh sab hai. But aapko bhi pata hai, mujhe bhi pata hai, woh khatam nahi hota. Toh better for, go for the upcoming batch that is going on.',
        'Okay, "GenAI with Python 2 is live cohort or recorded?" Abhi toh recorded hi hai kyunki live toh over ho chuka hai. Toh ab uski recordings hi hai. That is the case. Take decision based on this. "Sir, B.Com kar liya, ab B.Tech mein aana, career banana. BCA plus MCA karoon ya direct MCA? Please sir." I think B.Com ke baad direct B.Tech mein admission hota hai kya? I don\'t know yaar. Yeh toh actually mein college se hi poochna padega. I am not that expert. Main shayad consult nahi kar paunga ismein toh. Kyunki B.Com ke baad I think aapko BCA plus MCA karna padega. Then you can do M.Tech agar aapko woh route lena hai toh. Toh I think yaar, kisi college consultant se zyada poocho kyunki nahi idea yaar. Zabardasti ki rai nahi dunga. Jo nahi pata, mujhe sadly nahi pata hai.',
        '"I am in a small company as a fullstack dev in Ranchi." Good yaar. "Self-learning by doing their work and giving solution even to seniors." Good yaar, good stuff. "At only 20K. That\'s why I switched to work from home. I know how to build. How to grow?" If you know how to build na. Toh first kuch do-teen apne project as a sample bana lo jinko aap bol do ki yeh freelancing work... kya? Dekho, itna chalta hai. Hai na? Not the greatest thing to do but agar aapko banana aata hai toh build your own portfolio aur bolo ki haan, yeh client ke liye kiya tha maine. Aur uske basis pe unki complexity rakhna thodi acchi, since you already know how to build. Uske baad move on to freelancing work. Arre bahut freelancing work hai yaar. Bahut hai. Mujhe, mujhe bhi chahiye hote hain aise freelancer. They can help me in building the next project for the YouTube, help me in building the products that we are building. Toh aisa kuch ho toh main, mereko aur mere jaise logon ko bhi ping kar diya karo ki, "Sir, I can help you in building this project, then we can record it, host it on YouTube, hum shayad milke yeh sikha sakte hain. I will pay you, pay you good." Toh ping me up, agar aisa kuch hai toh.',
        'Okay, yeh toh ho gaya tha. "Next job offer ghosted. Confused. Get M.Tech? Please help." Toh next job offer try karo yaar. Get M.Tech... yaar, matlab itna value mujhe lagta nahi hai usmein ab hai. Look for next offer, yaar. Kab tak ek hi ek... ghosted ho gaya, koi baat nahi. Hum bhi toh ghost kar dete hain kai baar companies ko. Chalta hai. "Sir, main startup company mein as a full stack developer with React and Node.js par kaam kar raha hoon. Mujhe thoda guidance chahiye. Jaise AI bhi boom kar raha hai toh start karein AI study karna?" Haan ji, aa jaiye cohort mein. Uske baad yeh AI ka jo boom hai na, isko aap enjoy karne lagoge. Abhi jo darr lag raha hai na, is cohort mein aane ke baad log enjoy karte hain ki yaar, yeh itna difficult toh tha nahi. Now we are enjoying the building process and wahi hai. Wave ke upar aa jaate ho aap is cohort se. Abhi wave se dekh ke door se darr lagta hai ya phir you are under the wave. Jaise hi cohort mein aate ho, poora ek-do week, teen week, paanch week, jo bhi hamara chalta hai poora session, uske baad you actually ride the wave. That is the difference.',
        'Nice. "Thank you sir. Will there be exciting assignments, good projects in GenAI?" Yes. Dekho, GenAI ka hamare problem kya aata hai ki kuch projects acche, assignments vagera, woh hum bhi banate hain aur saath mein bhi banate hain aur banwate bhi hain aapse. Lekin jaise-jaise cohort end hoga na, yeh problem hum dono face karenge ki tech humein saara aata hai. Ab aap bolo, bolo RAG system build karna hai, memory based karna hai, custom AI build karna hai. We can build everything. Problem kya aata hai? Challenge batao ki aap batao sir, build kya karna hai? Like humein laga ki interview platform hona chahiye, woh humne build kar liya. Hum khud ke cursor design karte hain. Extended cursors bhi batate hain. Kaise tooling calls hote hain, agents bante hain. Yeh sab hum karte hain. But to be honest, agar aap cohort mein aate ho, yeh baat main aapse tab bhi karunga if you just remember this, ki hum end time pe bolenge ki, "Sir, give us some thoughts and ideas jispe kaam kar paayein hum. Humein tech saara aata hai." Wahi hai na, ek baar aapne suppose karo React seekh liya, API call seekh li, toh aap kahoge, "Sir, batao exciting kya banana hai? Kyunki foundation toh ab aata hai." Toh this is where things are.',
        '"Creating LMS. Any suggestion for uploading videos using Mux?" Mux mehenga hai yaar. "Thinking to implement S3 plus CloudFront. Can you guide?" Haan, woh zyada better option hai, solution hai. Mux se better toh... dekho Mux mehenga bahut hai yaar. Scale pe it doesn\'t work. If you are just one guy, two guy, ek-do client hai, tab tak theek hai, Mux chalta hai acche se. Vimeo is also a good option. You can offload all of your videos on Vimeo, if you have heard about it. Aur agar aap custom, khud ka encoder banate ho using S3 and CloudFront, that is good. But videos ko aapko break karna padega. HLS, DASH. By the way, mere YouTube channel pe hai ek video jahan pe maine poora bataya ki HLS pipelines aur yeh sab kaise jaate hain. Search for it and you will get it. But Mux mein costing ka hi dhyan rakhna. That is all thing. "Any video in micro-frontend?" Na yaar, mere paas ek book hai. By the way, offline copy maine kharidi hai micro-frontend ki. Nahi hai woh itna accha jitna dikhta hai.',
        '"Sir, BSc in Physics. Should I go for MCA or MSc?" Maybe MCA would be much easier for you. Yaar dekho, yeh degree wale na mujhe itne zyada samajh mein nahi aate hain. I am a B.Tech guy, M.Tech guy, toh mujhe woh tech wala zyada samajh aata hai. "Sir, it\'s been 2.5 years since college. One year went in family issue." Hota hai yaar. I can understand. "Just did one month internship in full stack. What are my chances of getting job now?" Dekho, chances aapke abhi bhi 100% hi hain. Aap kisi ka bhi course lo, mat lo, usse koi farak nahi padta hai. Job aapki lagegi. Lekin aapko ek 5 month, six month ka grind period lagne wala hai. Us grind period ke andar aapne jo bhi kaam kiya hai, jo bhi tech stack kiya hai na, usko wapas se refresh karna padega. Acche, insane project banane padenge jismein accha khasa code ho, 2-4000 line ka code ho, woh aapko wapas se lagega. Agar aapko consistency chahiye, toh mera cohort toh aane... ya kisi aur ka aa raha hoga. Woh join kar lo aur wahan se aapko chahiye ga. But haan, aapko 5-6 mahine ka consistently, khatarnak wala effort lagega kyunki gap hai thoda sa aapka 2.5 saal ka aur you have been away from the tech. Toh woh aapko cover up karna padega. Ab isko jitna chahe sugarcoat kar lo, ho jaayega, yeh... nahi, aapko 5 se 6 mahine ka accha wala grind lagne wala hai. No other option. Ab dekho, accha lage, nahi lage, I am not here for that.',
        '"Sir, I am working full time as a JS full stack dev. I want to explore GenAI Python. Don\'t know Python. Can I buy the course you launched recently in May?" Agar aap JS ke andar ho hi... agar aap JS full stack mein kaam karte ho, toh JS wala hi join kar lo na. Description mein link hai. JS in, Python, JS in AI bhi toh explore kar sakte hain hum poora ka poora. But agar aapko Python hi seekhna hai, toh aap le sakte ho. Recording, woh purani nahi hai zyada. In fact, sab kuch hi updated hai usmein. Everything. Toh aap woh bhi le sakte ho. But main toh recommend yahi karunga ki yaar, naya cohort hai, live hai, sab kuch, toh aa jao yaar isi mein hi.',
        '"Sir, I am a BCA student from Tier 3 institute. Please give me a roadmap. I am completely lost and abhi actively second sem end pe hoon." Dekho, kuch mat करो. Koi course-voarse nahi hai. Aap seedha Chai aur Code pe jaao. JavaScript ya Python, ek choose kar lo aur uski playlist khatam kar lo pehle. Sabse pehle yahi zaroori hai. Uske baad hi saara kaam start hoga aapka. "21 year old. Degree after 12th. Financial problem. Can I get job?" Haan ji, job sabko mil jaati hai. Itna load na lo. "In third year. Finished your JS, React, backend series." Good yaar, third year ke liye good hai. "Should I join the current dev cohort or wait for the December? Also starting DSA in C++. I am not sure with cohort, which cohort fits best. Would you love your advice?" Abhi dekho, ek cohort chal raha hai DSA ka already. I think ek-do hi class hui hai, woh bhi Java basics ki hi hui hai. Basic se mera matlab hai, collections covered hain. Toh agar aapko DSA karna hai, toh aap usmein kar sakte ho. Jo bhi code aapko batayenge sir, sir apna repo vagera bhi share kar denge C++ mein bhi hain unke paas saare solutions aur saare problems. Toh abhi woh kar lo. Cohort toh, I think abhi aap third year mein hi ho na, toh it would be super amazing for you. Agar aap December mein hi cohort join karte ho, wait for it. Tab tak Chai aur Code se padho na aur bhi content. Arre laayenge hum content, aap chinta mat karo. Aur bhi aa raha hai, ban raha hai. Toh usko aap enjoy karo aur cohort December mein hi join karo. Wait for it. Acchi cheezon ke liye kai baar intezaar karna padta hai. Kar lo thoda intezaar.',
        '"Web cohort kab aayega? Please release it soon." December mein seats open hogi. Seats I think jaldi open kar denge. But, Jan... Jan. Dekho, humne bahut effort diya tha aur humein break banta tha wahan pe. "Job timing 6:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Toh live course lena sahi hoga?" Aah, dekho yaar, aap live toh attend nahi kar paoge. Agar 6:00 p.m. se 2:00 a.m. hai toh, obvious si baat hai, live job karna bahut difficult rahega. Agar apni job ke beech mein ek ghanta nikaal ke, do, dedh ghanta nikaal ke join kar sakte ho, toh do it. Otherwise aap recordings dekh sakte ho. Recording phir aap chahe Python wala lo, chahe JavaScript wala lo, it\'s just means the same. I will not sugarcoat it. I will give you very honest opinion ki maza tabhi hai jab aap live mein aa jao. Kaise bhi ek, dedh ghanta, 2 ghanta agar job se nikaal sako toh. It would be really life-changing for you. But agar nahi le sakte, toh phir dekho, kabhi bhi join kar lo. Phir aisa kuch nahi hai. Live ka maza dekho, live discussions aur in sab mein hai.',
        'Okay. Next. "How to showcase backend project in resume?" Hmm, very difficult. PRD se hi kar sakte ho but, vaise kar sakte hain yaar. Resume mein just likho na wahan pe ki build a backend for this entire ecosystem. Features wahan pe likho. Aisa zaroori nahi hai ki frontend ke bina project showcase nahi hote hain. PRDs pe focus karo ki summary kaise ho sakti hai PRD ki. "How to get job in Go?" I have done full stack? Go ka market actually mein bahut niche hai plus out of India niche hai. Toh aapko usi ecosystem mein dekhna padega. I mostly stay in the JavaScript and Python ecosystem. "Building rock network idea. Snapchat competition." Nice yaar. Good stuff. "Want you, no, I am not available."',
        'Okay, chalo ji, bas ab itna hi karte hain. End karte hain isko. "Swift kidhar se learn karoon? Aapka Udemy se?" Nahi, mera nahi hai woh course Udemy ka. That is from another company. They don\'t pay me even. Toh nahi, mera nahi hai woh course. Don\'t go for that. Hacking with Swift is a very good website. "Java ya Python ke baad web kar loon Udemy wale se?" Haan haan, Udemy, my Udemy course, one of the best course. Aap jaiye, bejhijhak jaiye usmein. No problem at all. "Student of Java DSA cohort. As just a feedback, ask Prateek sir to speed a bit and teach in proactive way. Maybe one-two session by you would be very helpful." Surely, main un tak pahuncha dunga. Prateek sir actually mein na, thoda sa students ko bahut hi basic se leke ki, "Nahi yaar, tumhein nahi aata. Chalo main ek-ek cheez batata hoon, ek-ek cheez batata hoon." Toh woh kabhi kabhar thoda, thoda sa slow pace rakhta hai. Teen-chaar class baad aapko uski aadat ho jaati hai aur woh thoda sa speed bhi badhate hain. But initial classes mein na, Prateek sir har student ko aise leke chalte hain, "Nahi aata tumhein yaar, main batata hoon." Aur aap jitne doubt poochte ho na, woh chahe 2 ghante extra baithte hain but woh poore ek-ek doubt solve karke hi nikalte hain. That I would 100% say ki yaar Prateek sir goes really extra in that case. Toh definitely, I will say, proactive woh dheere-dheere hote hain. Toh just give them a little bit time. Woh ho jaayenge and work for it. But really happy that you will enjoy that and abhi bhi aap enjoy kar hi rahe ho. But definitely, dekho yeh kaam mat karna please. Ek yahan pe Raghuveer Singh keh rahe hain, "Is it good idea to recite Python docs 100k times to memorize it?" Really, really bad idea. Aisa idea aapko deta kaun hai? Pehli baat toh, aise mat karo. "First year BCA, teaching experience, want to become teacher, help." Depend karta hai, agar tech mein kuch padhate hue, kuch aisa ho, toh you can ping me also. We can help you in hosting some of the sessions. Hamare student ke liye hum free kar denge. Aapko teaching, agar kuch padhane ka aisa mann hai, toh go ahead, work for it. Agar kuch tech hai, toh I am even ready to pay for you as well. Agar aap mein se bhi koi aisa teacher hai jo kuch padhana chahta hai, want to work with me or anything, ping me up. Nice. Context limit. Nice Aniruddh. I was about to ping you after this. So live stream ab end karte hain. I need to do some work jo main kaafi time se avoid kar raha tha. Ab mujhe kar lena chahiye. Theek hai? Okay. Bye bye everyone. Aaj ke liye itna hi karte hain. Thank you so much. Bye bye.',

        "Title ka name reverse hai. Ya, tumhein pata hai? Actually kya hua? I'll tell you. Main live pichle 5 minute se hoon but main galat YouTube account se connected tha. Toh ek private YouTube account hai, matlab just for watching. Toh mera jo streamer jo studio hai woh usse connected tha. Toh main soch raha hoon koi aaya kyun nahi abhi tak. And then I realized ki okay, main live hoon 5 minute se but main kisi aur channel ke upar live hoon. Toh phir theek hai. Usko band kiya, disconnect kiya, and wapas idhar aaya. That's why it's been 11. Main 11:00 baje live aa gaya tha.",

Build agents. 2025 is for agents. Bas agents banao. By the way, kisi ne Claude code try kara? Agent se yaad aaya mujhe Claude code. Matlab it is actually awesome, man. Jo Claude code CLI hai na woh sach mein bahut awesome hai. Matlab the way it codes, the way it thinks. Tumhein ek mazedar baat bataun? I am not sure agar aap us cheez ko maanoge ya nahi. But main tumhein ek mazedar cheez bataun. Tumne abhi recently notice kara hoga ki Teach.es ke upar subscriptions ka option aa gaya. Right? It's a new feature. Matlab poora ki because you know, Teach.es ke upar everything is multitenant and uske upar subscriptions ko implement karna was a little bit challenging from both system design perspective, and both from user side or UI side.",

Matlab theek hai, I know how to do it but Claude code ko try karte hain. I gave it a prompt and usne 3 ghante mein with UI, with backend, usne kar diya. And sach mein jo aap proposs.dev ke upar subscriptions ka option dekh rahe ho na, woh vibe coded hai. I was really amazed the way it has coded. Matlab, matlab aisa nahi hai. Aisa nahi hai ki bas theek hai uthaya aur code kar diya. Usne sach mein poore codebase ko understand kara. Toh that was really awesome.

        "System design hamesha na ek debatable topic rehna chahiye. Aap debate karo na. System design is always for debating. If you think about it, ki aisa matlab maine usually dekha hai ki courses mein ya phir jo aur videos aur series hoti hain na jisko woh as a syllabus dekhte hain, usme woh kya karte hain? Woh bolte hain ki yaar yeh vertical scaling hoti hai, ab hum isko solve karenge horizontal scaling. Arre aise thodi na hota hai. Dono side ki baat karo na, thoda sa. Theek hai. That is a very very basic thing ki ek vertical scaling hota hai, ek horizontal scaling hota hai. It's a very basic thing. But still, I need someone jo defend kare ki haan, vertical scaling bhi accha hai. You have stateful applications, right? Toh isliye na mujhe thoda sa debate karna accha lagta hai system design ke upar, rather than just listen. Jab aap koi programming language seekh rahe ho, wahan pe kuch debate nahi hota hai. Aap JavaScript mein `const`, `let` aur `var` ko use karke aap variables bana sakte ho. Toh iske upar koi debate thodi na karega. Matlab theek hai, karna chahte ho kar sakte ho, but it's not a debatable topic. It's an understandable topic. But system design is always debate. As someone, as you know, everyone says, YouTube bhi ek video platform hai, Netflix bhi ek video platform hai, Hotstar bhi ek video platform hai, but in teeno ka system design aapas mein bilkul different hai. There are debates. System design mein debate hoti hai ki hum kaise scale karenge? Hum kya karenge? What is their trade-off?",

Next.js sirf do ya teen din ki kahani hogi phir. Aur Next.js agar badal bhi jaati hai, because agar aapne notice kiya hoga, Next.js ke andar bahut frequently updates aate hain. Next.js ko master karna kaafi mushkil hai. Because jab tak aap usme master hone lagoge, woh phir badal denge. Toh I would say focus on foundation.

Dekho, main, I'll tell you one thing. Yeh jo IDEs aa chuke hain na, jo aapka yeh jo AI hai, jab tak yeh ChatGPT aur yeh web browser ke andar tha na, tab tak yeh theek tha. Ab yeh ghus chuka hai aapke coding editors ke andar. Theek hai? Aapke Cursor IDE ke andar, aapke VS Code ke andar. Now there is a problem. Developers ne sochna hi band kar diya hai. Toh there are two things. Jinke paas toh already experience hai, matlab ki jo pichle 5-6 saalon se ya usse zyada se coding kar rahe hain, jinke logics ban chuke hain, unke liye toh yaar dekho yeh typing speed bachata hai. Because technically, coding is 90% thinking and phir 10% coding. Toh unke liye toh yeh badhiya hai ki bhai maine kuch socha, maine prompt diya. Theek hai yaar, tu code kar de. Kaun jaake code karega? But new developers ne na isko thinking and coding, dono ke liye use karna shuru kar diya hai. Toh I think in the coming years, jo abhi freshers hain na, inka jo mindset hai woh utna grow nahi kar paayega. Eventually, jo log coding, matlab thinking mein acche honge na, woh ace kar jaayenge. Toh unke liye competition bahut kam hone wala hai. Sorry to say, I don't want to hurt anyone's feeling but that is true. Jitne bhi yeh freshers hain and you know, abhi college students hain, yeh sab AI ko use kar rahe hain in place of thinking, rather than coding. So haan, agar aap AI ko thinking mein use nahi kar rahe ho, aap khud se code kar rahe ho, aap khud se logic building kar rahe ho, toh congratulations.

Agar aap yahan par thoda distributed architecture ke baare mein bata sakte hain, right? Aap edge cases bata sakte hain ki yaar jab zyada users, jab zyada users aate hain toh aapko pata hai yeh ek problem aati hai, bottleneck aati hai. Rate limiting ki baat kar sakte ho. External API calls rate limiting ki baat kar sakte ho. Multiple queue systems ki baat kar sakte ho. Thoda sa database indexing ke baare mein baat kar rahe ho. Agar mujhe lag raha, agar kisi bhi interviewer ko lag raha hai ki yaar you are actually talking about production use cases, toh matlab ki aap experienced ho. Because technically, coding toh sabko aata hai. Coding toh yaar ek junior developer ko bhi aata hai. Coding senior developers ko bhi aata hai. But senior developers ne, matlab woh hai na, error khaake woh seekh gaye hain. Unhone itne errors face kar liye zindagi mein. Unko pata hai ki kahan par system phat sakta hai. Toh they know those edge cases aur unko pata hoga ki kaise isko pehle hi din se implement karna hai. Toh I think that's what makes you a senior developer just in case you are from the backend context. Toh yeh cheezein aapse expect ki jaayengi. Agar aap frontend ke andar ho toh same thing goes, right, ki agar aap user experience ke baare mein dhyan de pa rahe ho, because technically you know all the edge cases ki kahan par cheezein phat'ti hain.",
